# To Master This Art

## Why Build This Framework

As a beginner, I found myself struggling to grasp existing frameworks like actix-web and Rocket. When I attempted to rewrite a previous Go web service in Rust, each framework seemed more complex than those available in Go. Given Rust's already steep learning curve, why complicate web frameworks further?

When Tokio introduced the Axum framework, I was thrilled, thinking I could finally stop maintaining my own web framework. However, I soon realized that while Axum appeared simple, it required extensive type gymnastics and generic definitions. Crafting even a basic middleware demanded deep Rust expertise and writing copious amounts of obscure boilerplate code.

Thus, I decided to continue maintaining my unique web framework—one that is intuitive, feature-rich, and beginner-friendly.

## Is Salvo Right for You?

Salvo is simple yet comprehensive and powerful, arguably the strongest in the Rust ecosystem. Despite its capabilities, it remains easy to learn and use, sparing you any "self-castration" pains.

- **Ideal for Rust beginners**: CRUD operations are commonplace, and with Salvo, such tasks feel as straightforward as with frameworks in other languages (e.g., Express, Koa, Gin, Flask). In some aspects, Salvo is even more abstract and concise.

- **Suitable for production**: If you aim to deploy Rust in production for robust, high-speed servers, Salvo fits the bill. Although not yet at version 1.0, its core features have undergone years of iteration, ensuring stability and timely issue resolution.

- **Perfect for you**, especially if your hair is thinning and shedding daily.

## Achieving Simplicity

Hyper handles many low-level implementations, making it a reliable foundation for general needs. Salvo follows this approach, offering a powerful and flexible routing system alongside essential features like Acme, OpenAPI, and JWT authentication.

Salvo unifies Handlers and Middleware: Middleware _is_ a Handler. Both are attached to the Router via `hoop`. Essentially, they process `Request` and may write data to `Response`. A Handler receives three parameters: `Request`, `Depot` (for temporary data during request processing), and `Response`.

For convenience, you can omit unnecessary parameters or ignore their order.

```rust
use salvo::prelude::*;

#[handler]
async fn hello_world(_req: &mut Request, _depot: &mut Depot, res: &mut Response) {
    res.render("Hello world");
}
#[handler]
async fn hello_world(res: &mut Response) {
    res.render("Hello world");
}
```

The routing API is exceptionally simple yet powerful. For typical use cases, you only need to focus on the `Router` type.

Additionally, if a struct implements relevant traits, Salvo can automatically generate OpenAPI documentation, extract parameters, handle errors gracefully, and return user-friendly messages. This makes writing handlers as intuitive as writing ordinary functions. We'll explore these features in detail later. Here’s an example:

```rust
#[endpoint(tags("message_logs"))]
pub async fn create_message_log_handler(
    input: JsonBody<CreateOrUpdateMessageLog>,
    depot: &mut Depot,
) -> APPResult<Json<MessageLog>> {
    let db = utils::get_db(depot)?;
    let log = create_message_log(&input, db).await?;
    Ok(Json(log))
}
```

In this example, `JsonBody<CreateOrUpdateMessageLog>` automatically parses JSON from the request body into the `CreateOrUpdateMessageLog` type (supporting multiple data sources and nested types). The `#[endpoint]` macro generates OpenAPI documentation for this endpoint, simplifying parameter extraction and error handling.

## Routing System

I believe Salvo’s routing system stands out. Routers can be flat or tree-like, distinguishing between _business logic trees_ and _access directory trees_. The business logic tree organizes routers based on business needs, which may not align with the access directory tree.

Typically, routes are written like this:

```rust
Router::new().path("articles").get(list_articles).post(create_article);
Router::new()
    .path("articles/{id}")
    .get(show_article)
    .patch(edit_article)
    .delete(delete_article);
```

Often, viewing articles and listing them don’t require user login, but creating, editing, or deleting articles does. Salvo’s nested routing system elegantly handles this. We can group public routes together:

```rust
Router::new()
    .path("articles")
    .get(list_articles)
    .push(Router::new().path("{id}").get(show_article));
```

Then, group protected routes with middleware for authentication:

```rust
Router::new()
    .path("articles")
    .hoop(auth_check)
    .post(create_article)
    .push(Router::new().path("{id}").patch(edit_article).delete(delete_article));
```

Even though both routers share the same `path("articles")`, they can be added to the same parent router, resulting in:

```rust
Router::new()
    .push(
        Router::new()
            .path("articles")
            .get(list_articles)
            .push(Router::new().path("{id}").get(show_article)),
    )
    .push(
        Router::new()
            .path("articles")
            .hoop(auth_check)
            .post(create_article)
            .push(Router::new().path("{id}").patch(edit_article).delete(delete_article)),
    );
```

`{id}` matches a path segment. Typically, an article `id` is numeric, so we can restrict matching with a regex: `r"{id:/\d+/}"`.

# Quick Start

## Install Rust

If you haven't installed Rust yet, you can use the official (`rustup`)\[[https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-01-installation.html](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-01-installation.html)] to install Rust.

:::tip
The minimum supported Rust version for Salvo is 1.89. Run `rustup update` to ensure you have a compatible Rust version installed.
:::

## Write Your First Salvo Program

Create a new project:

```bash
cargo new hello --bin
```

Add dependencies to `Cargo.toml`:

```toml file="<root>/codes/hello/Cargo.toml"
[package]
name = "example-hello"
version.workspace = true
edition.workspace = true
publish.workspace = true
rust-version.workspace = true

[dependencies]
salvo = { workspace = true }
tokio = { workspace = true, features = ["macros"] }
tracing.workspace = true
tracing-subscriber.workspace = true

```

In `main.rs`, create a simple function handler named `hello`, which simply prints the text `"Hello world"`.

```rust file="<root>/codes/hello/src/main.rs"
use salvo::prelude::*;

// Handler for English greeting
#[handler]
async fn hello() -> &'static str {
    "Hello World"
}

// Handler for Chinese greeting
#[handler]
async fn hello_zh() -> Result<&'static str, ()> {
    Ok("你好，世界！")
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    // Initialize logging subsystem
    tracing_subscriber::fmt().init();

    // Bind server to port 8698
    let acceptor = TcpListener::new("0.0.0.0:8698").bind().await;

    // Create router with two endpoints:
    // - / (root path) returns English greeting
    // - /你好 returns Chinese greeting
    let router = Router::new()
        .get(hello)
        .push(Router::with_path("你好").get(hello_zh));

    // Print router structure for debugging
    println!("{router:?}");

    // Start serving requests
    Server::new(acceptor).serve(router).await;
}

```

Congratulations! Your first Salvo program is complete. Just run `cargo run` in the command line, then open `http://127.0.0.1:8698` in your browser.

## Detailed Explanation

Here, `hello_world` is a `Handler` used to process user requests. The `#[handler]` attribute allows a function to conveniently implement the `Handler` trait. Moreover, it enables us to write function parameters in various simplified ways.

- Original form:

  ```rust
  #[handler]
  async fn hello(_req: &mut Request, _depot: &mut Depot, res: &mut Response, _ctrl: &mut FlowCtrl) {
      res.render("Hello world");
  }
  ```

- You can omit unused parameters in the function. For example, `_req`, `_depot`, and `_ctrl` are not used here and can be omitted entirely:

  ```rust
  #[handler]
  async fn hello(res: &mut Response) {
      res.render("Hello world");
  }
  ```

- Any type can be used as the function's return type as long as it implements the `Writer` trait. For instance, `&str` implements `Writer`, and when returned, it prints plain text:

  ```rust
  #[handler]
  async fn hello(res: &mut Response) -> &'static str {
      "Hello world"
  }
  ```

- More commonly, we need to use `Result<T, E>` as the return type to handle errors during function execution. If both `T` and `E` implement `Writer`, then `Result<T, E>` can be used as a return value:

  ```rust
  #[handler]
  async fn hello(res: &mut Response) -> Result<&'static str, ()> {
      Ok("Hello world")
  }
  ```

## Sleek HTTP3

They say HTTP3 is as agile as a swallow, a dream many programmers have longed for but couldn't achieve. This time, Salvo makes it happen, allowing everyone to effortlessly enjoy the wonderful services brought by HTTP3!

First, enable the HTTP3 feature in `Cargo.toml`, then modify `main.rs` as follows:


**main.rs**

```rust file="<root>/codes/hello-h3/src/main.rs"
use salvo::conn::rustls::{Keycert, RustlsConfig};
use salvo::prelude::*;

// Handler function responding with "Hello World" for HTTP/3 requests
#[handler]
async fn hello() -> &'static str {
    "Hello World"
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    // Initialize logging system
    tracing_subscriber::fmt().init();

    // Load TLS certificate and private key from embedded PEM files
    let cert = include_bytes!("../certs/cert.pem").to_vec();
    let key = include_bytes!("../certs/key.pem").to_vec();

    // Create router with single endpoint
    let router = Router::new().get(hello);

    // Configure TLS settings using Rustls
    let config = RustlsConfig::new(Keycert::new().cert(cert.as_slice()).key(key.as_slice()));

    // Create TCP listener with TLS encryption on port 8698
    let listener = TcpListener::new(("0.0.0.0", 8698)).rustls(config.clone());

    // Create QUIC listener and combine with TCP listener
    let acceptor = QuinnListener::new(config.build_quinn_config().unwrap(), ("0.0.0.0", 8698))
        .join(listener)
        .bind()
        .await;

    // Start server supporting both HTTP/3 (QUIC) and HTTPS (TCP)
    Server::new(acceptor).serve(router).await;
}

```


**Cargo.toml**

```toml file="<root>/codes/hello-h3/Cargo.toml"
[package]
name = "example-hello-h3"
version.workspace = true
edition.workspace = true
publish.workspace = true
rust-version.workspace = true

[dependencies]
salvo = { workspace = true, features = ["quinn"] }
tokio = { workspace = true, features = ["macros"] }
tracing.workspace = true
tracing-subscriber.workspace = true

```

# Router

## What is Routing

[`Router`](https://docs.rs/salvo_core/latest/salvo_core/routing/struct.Router.html) defines which middleware and `Handler` will process an HTTP request. This is the most fundamental and core functionality in Salvo.

Internally, a `Router` is essentially composed of a series of filters. When a request arrives, the router tests itself and its descendants in order, from top to bottom, to see if they can match the request. If a match is successful, the middleware on the entire chain formed by the router and its descendant routers are executed sequentially. If during processing, the `Response` status is set to an error (4XX, 5XX) or a redirect (3XX), subsequent middleware and `Handler` will be skipped. You can also manually call `ctrl.skip_rest()` to skip the remaining middleware and `Handler`.

During the matching process, there exists a URL path information object, which can be considered as an object that must be completely consumed by filters during matching. If all filters in a certain Router match successfully, and this URL path information has been fully consumed, it is considered a "successful match".

For example:

```rust
Router::with_path("articles").get(list_articles).post(create_article);
```

Is actually equivalent to:

```rust
Router::new()
    // PathFilter can filter request paths. It only matches successfully if the request path contains the "articles" segment.
    // Otherwise, the match fails. For example: /articles/123 matches successfully, while /articles_list/123
    // contains "articles" but fails to match because of the trailing "_list".
    .filter(PathFilter::new("articles"))

    // If the root matches successfully and the request method is GET, the inner child router can match successfully,
    // and the request is handled by list_articles.
    .push(Router::new().filter(filters::get()).handle(list_articles))

    // If the root matches successfully and the request method is POST, the inner child router can match successfully,
    // and the request is handled by create_article.
    .push(Router::new().filter(filters::post()).handle(create_article));
```

If accessing `GET /articles/`, it is considered a successful match, and `list_articles` is executed. However, if accessing `GET /articles/123`, the route match fails and returns a 404 error because `Router::with_path("articles")` only consumes the `/articles` part of the URL path information, leaving the `/123` part unconsumed, thus the match is considered failed. To achieve a successful match, the route can be changed to:

```rust
Router::with_path("articles/{**}").get(list_articles).post(create_article);
```

Here, `{**}` matches any remaining path, so it can match `GET /articles/123` and execute `list_articles`.

## Flat Definition

We can define routes in a flat style:

```rust
Router::with_path("writers").get(list_writers).post(create_writer);
Router::with_path("writers/{id}").get(show_writer).patch(edit_writer).delete(delete_writer);
Router::with_path("writers/{id}/articles").get(list_writer_articles);
```

## Tree-like Definition

We can also define routes in a tree-like structure, which is the recommended approach:

```rust
Router::with_path("writers")
    .get(list_writers)
    .post(create_writer)
    .push(
        Router::with_path("{id}")
            .get(show_writer)
            .patch(edit_writer)
            .delete(delete_writer)
            .push(Router::with_path("articles").get(list_writer_articles)),
    );
```

This form of definition makes Router definitions hierarchical, clear, and simple for complex projects.

Many methods in `Router` return `Self` after being called, facilitating chained code writing. Sometimes, you need to decide how to route based on certain conditions. The routing system also provides the `then` function, which is easy to use:

```rust
Router::new()
    .push(
        Router::with_path("articles")
            .get(list_articles)
            .push(Router::with_path("{id}").get(show_article))
            .then(|router|{
                if admin_mode() {
                    router.post(create_article).push(
                        Router::with_path("{id}").patch(update_article).delete(delete_writer)
                    )
                } else {
                    router
                }
            }),
    );
```

This example means that routes for creating, editing, and deleting articles are only added when the server is in `admin_mode`.

## Retrieving Parameters from Routes

In the code above, `{id}` defines a parameter. We can retrieve its value through the `Request` instance:

```rust
#[handler]
async fn show_writer(req: &mut Request) {
    let id = req.param::<i64>("id").unwrap();
}
```

`{id}` matches a segment in the path. Normally, an article's `id` is just a number. In this case, we can use a regular expression to restrict the matching rule for `id`, like `r"{id|\d+}"`.

For numeric types, there's an even simpler method using `<id:num>`. Specific notations are:

- `{id:num}` matches any number of digit characters.
- `{id:num[10]}` matches exactly a specific number of digit characters; here, 10 means it matches exactly 10 digits.
- `{id:num(..10)}` matches 1 to 9 digit characters.
- `{id:num(3..10)}` matches 3 to 9 digit characters.
- `{id:num(..=10)}` matches 1 to 10 digit characters.
- `{id:num(3..=10)}` matches 3 to 10 digit characters.
- `{id:num(10..)}` matches at least 10 digit characters.

You can also match all remaining path segments using `{**}`, `{*+}`, or `{*?}`. For better code readability, you can add appropriate names to make the path semantics clearer, e.g., `{**file_path}`.

- `{**}`: Represents a wildcard match where the matched part can be an empty string. For example, the path `/files/{**rest_path}` matches `/files`, `/files/abc.txt`, `/files/dir/abc.txt`.
- `{*+}`: Represents a wildcard match where the matched part must exist and cannot be an empty string. For example, the path `/files/{*+rest_path}` does NOT match `/files` but matches `/files/abc.txt`, `/files/dir/abc.txt`.
- `{*?}`: Represents a wildcard match where the matched part can be an empty string but can only contain one path segment. For example, the path `/files/{*？rest_path}` does NOT match `/files/dir/abc.txt` but matches `/files`, `/files/abc.txt`.

Multiple expressions can be combined to match the same path segment, e.g., `/articles/article_{id:num}/`, `/images/{name}.{ext}`.

## Adding Middleware

Middleware can be added via the `hoop` function on a router:

```rust
Router::new()
    .hoop(check_authed)
    .path("writers")
    .get(list_writers)
    .post(create_writer)
    .push(
        Router::with_path("{id}")
            .get(show_writer)
            .patch(edit_writer)
            .delete(delete_writer)
            .push(Router::with_path("articles").get(list_writer_articles)),
    );
```

In this example, the root router uses `check_authed` to check if the current user is logged in. All descendant routers are affected by this middleware.

If users are only browsing `writer` information and articles, we might prefer they can browse without logging in. We can define the routes like this:

```rust
Router::new()
    .push(
        Router::new()
            .hoop(check_authed)
            .path("writers")
            .post(create_writer)
            .push(Router::with_path("{id}").patch(edit_writer).delete(delete_writer)),
    )
    .push(
        Router::with_path("writers").get(list_writers).push(
            Router::with_path("{id}")
                .get(show_writer)
                .push(Router::with_path("articles").get(list_writer_articles)),
        ),
    );
```

Even though two routers have the same path definition `path("articles")`, they can still be added to the same parent router.

## Filters

`Router` internally uses filters to determine if a route matches. Filters support basic logical operations using `or` or `and`. A router can contain multiple filters; when all filters match successfully, the route matches successfully.

Website path information is a tree structure, but this tree structure is not equivalent to the tree structure organizing routers. A website path may correspond to multiple router nodes. For example, some content under the `articles/` path may require login to view, while others do not. We can organize subpaths requiring login verification under a router containing login verification middleware, and those not requiring verification under another router without it:

```rust
Router::new()
    .push(
        Router::with_path("articles")
            .get(list_articles)
            .push(Router::new().path("{id}").get(show_article)),
    )
    .push(
        Router::with_path("articles")
            .hoop(auth_check)
            .post(list_articles)
            .push(Router::new().path("{id}").patch(edit_article).delete(delete_article)),
    );
```

Routers use filters to filter requests and send them to the corresponding middleware and `Handler` for processing.

`path` and `method` are two of the most commonly used filters. `path` is used to match path information; `method` is used to match the request's Method, e.g., GET, POST, PATCH, etc.

We can connect router filters using `and`, `or`:

```rust
Router::with_filter(filters::path("hello").and(filters::get()));
```

### Path Filter

Filters based on request paths are the most frequently used. Path filters can define parameters, for example:

```rust
Router::with_path("articles/{id}").get(show_article);
Router::with_path("files/{**rest_path}").get(serve_file)
```

In a `Handler`, they can be retrieved via the `Request` object's `get_param` function:

```rust
#[handler]
pub async fn show_article(req: &mut Request) {
    let article_id = req.param::<i64>("id");
}

#[handler]
pub async fn serve_file(req: &mut Request) {
    let rest_path = req.param::<i64>("rest_path");
}
```

### Method Filter

Filters requests based on the HTTP request's `Method`, for example:

```rust
Router::new().get(show_article).patch(update_article).delete(delete_article);
```

Here, `get`, `patch`, `delete` are all Method filters. This is actually equivalent to:

```rust
use salvo::routing::filter;

let mut root_router = Router::new();
let show_router = Router::with_filter(filters::get()).handle(show_article);
let update_router = Router::with_filter(filters::patch()).handle(update_article);
let delete_router = Router::with_filter(filters::get()).handle(delete_article);
Router::new().push(show_router).push(update_router).push(delete_router);
```

## Custom Wisp

For certain frequently occurring matching expressions, we can assign a short name via `PathFilter::register_wisp_regex` or `PathFilter::register_wisp_builder`. For instance, GUID format often appears in paths. The normal way is to write it like this every time matching is needed:

```rust
Router::with_path("/articles/<id:/[0-9a-fA-F]{8}-([0-9a-fA-F]{4}-){3}[0-9a-fA-F]{12}/>");
Router::with_path("/users/<id:/[0-9a-fA-F]{8}-([0-9a-fA-F]{4}-){3}[0-9a-fA-F]{12}/>");
```

Writing this complex regex every time is error-prone and makes code less readable. You can do this instead:

```rust
use salvo::routing::filter::PathFilter;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    let guid = regex::Regex::new("[0-9a-fA-F]{8}-([0-9a-fA-F]{4}-){3}[0-9a-fA-F]{12}").unwrap();
    PathFilter::register_wisp_regex("guid", guid);
    Router::new()
        .push(Router::with_path("/articles/{id:guid}").get(show_article))
        .push(Router::with_path("/users/{id:guid}").get(show_user));
}
```

You only need to register it once. Afterwards, you can directly use simple notation like `{id:guid}` to match GUIDs, simplifying code writing.

## Coming from a Controller-based Web Framework, How to Understand Router?

The main differences between routing-designed web frameworks (like Salvo) and traditional MVC or Controller-designed frameworks are:

- **Flexibility**: Routing design allows for more flexible definition of request processing flows, enabling precise control over the logic for each path. For example, in Salvo you can directly define handler functions for specific paths:
  ```rust
  Router::with_path("articles").get(list_articles).post(create_article);
  ```
  In Controller design, you typically need to define a controller class first, then define multiple methods within the class to handle different requests:
  ```java
  @Controller
  public class ArticleController {
      @GetMapping("/articles")
      public List<Article> listArticles() { /* ... */ }
      
      @PostMapping("/articles")
      public Article createArticle(@RequestBody Article article) { /* ... */ }
  }
  ```

- **Middleware Integration**: Routing frameworks usually provide a more concise way to integrate middleware, allowing middleware to be applied to specific routes. Salvo's middleware can be precisely applied to particular routes:
  ```rust
  Router::new()
      .push(
          Router::with_path("admin/articles")
              .hoop(admin_auth_middleware)  // Apply auth middleware only to admin routes
              .get(list_all_articles)
              .post(create_article),
      )
      .push(
          Router::with_path("articles")  // Public routes don't need auth
              .get(list_public_articles),
      );
  ```

- **Code Organization**: Routing design tends to organize code based on functionality or API endpoints, rather than the Model-View-Controller layering of MVC.
  Routing design encourages organizing code according to API endpoint functionality:
  ```rust
  // user_routes.rs - User-related routes and handling logic
  pub fn user_routes() -> Router {
      Router::with_path("users")
          .get(list_users)
          .post(create_user)
          .push(Router::with_path("{id}").get(get_user).delete(delete_user))
  }

  // article_routes.rs - Article-related routes and handling logic
  pub fn article_routes() -> Router {
      Router::with_path("articles")
          .get(list_articles)
          .post(create_article)
  }

  // Combine routes in the main application
  let router = Router::new()
      .push(user_routes())
      .push(article_routes());
  ```

- **Lightweight**: Routing design is typically more lightweight, reducing framework-enforced concepts and constraints. You can introduce only the components you need without following a strict framework structure.

Routing design makes API development more intuitive, especially suitable for building modern microservices and RESTful APIs. In frameworks like Salvo, routing is a core concept that directly reflects the structure and behavior of the API, making the code easier to understand and maintain. In contrast, traditional Controller design often requires more configuration and conventions to achieve the same functionality.

# Request

In Salvo, user request data can be obtained through [`Request`](https://docs.rs/salvo_core/latest/salvo_core/http/request/struct.Request.html):

## Quick Overview

Request is a struct representing an HTTP request, providing comprehensive request handling capabilities:

- Operates on basic attributes (URI, method, version)
- Handles request headers and Cookies
- Parses various parameters (path, query, form)
- Supports request body processing and file uploads
- Offers multiple data parsing methods (JSON, form, etc.)
- Implements unified type-safe data extraction via the extract method

```rust
#[handler]
async fn hello(req: &mut Request) -> String {
    req.params().get("id").cloned().unwrap_or_default()
}
```

## Getting Query Parameters

Query parameters can be obtained via `get_query`:

```rust
req.query::<String>("id");
```

## Getting Form Data

Form data can be obtained via `get_form`. This function is asynchronous:

```rust
req.form::<String>("id").await;
```

## Getting JSON Deserialized Data

```rust
req.parse_json::<User>().await;
```

## Extracting Request Data

`Request` provides multiple methods to parse this data into strongly-typed structures.

- `parse_params`: Parses the request's router params into a specific data type.
- `parse_queries`: Parses the request's URL queries into a specific data type.
- `parse_headers`: Parses the request's HTTP headers into a specific data type.
- `parse_json`: Parses the data in the HTTP body part of the request as JSON format into a specific type.
- `parse_form`: Parses the data in the HTTP body part of the request as a Form into a specific type.
- `parse_body`: Parses the data in the HTTP body part into a specific type based on the request's `content-type`.
- `extract`: Can merge different data sources to parse out a specific type.

## Parsing Principle

Here, a custom `serde::Deserializer` is used to extract data from structures like `HashMap<String, String>` and `HashMap<String, Vec<String>>` into specific data types.

For example: `URL queries` are actually extracted as a [MultiMap](https://docs.rs/multimap/latest/multimap/struct.MultiMap.html) type. `MultiMap` can be thought of as a data structure similar to `HashMap<String, Vec<String>>`. If the requested URL is `http://localhost/users?id=123&id=234`, and our target type is:

```rust
#[derive(Deserialize)]
struct User {
  id: i64
}
```

Then the first `id=123` will be parsed, and `id=234` will be discarded:

```rust
let user: User = req.parse_queries().unwrap();
assert_eq!(user.id, 123);
```

If our provided type is:

```rust
#[derive(Deserialize)]
struct Users {
  ids: Vec<i64>
}
```

Then both `id=123&id=234` will be parsed:

```rust
let users: Users = req.parse_queries().unwrap();
assert_eq!(user.ids, vec![123, 234]);
```

### Built-in Extractors

The framework includes built-in request parameter extractors. These extractors can significantly simplify code for handling HTTP requests.

:::tip
To use them, you need to add the `"oapi" feature` in your `Cargo.toml`

```rust
salvo = {version = "*", features = ["oapi"]}
```

:::

Then you can import the extractors:

```rust
use salvo::{oapi::extract::JsonBody, prelude::*};
```

#### JsonBody

Used to extract JSON data from the request body and deserialize it into a specified type.

```rust
#[handler]
async fn create_user(json: JsonBody<User>) -> String {
    let user = json.into_inner();
    format!("Created user with ID {}", user.id)
}
```

#### FormBody

Extracts form data from the request body and deserializes it into a specified type.

```rust
#[handler]
async fn update_user(form: FormBody<User>) -> String {
    let user = form.into_inner();
    format!("Updated user with ID {}", user.id)
}
```

#### CookieParam

Extracts a specific value from the request's Cookies.

```rust
// The second parameter: if true, into_inner() will panic if the value doesn't exist.
// If false, into_inner() returns Option<T>.
#[handler]
fn get_user_from_cookie(user_id: CookieParam<i64,true>) -> String {
    format!("User ID from Cookie: {}", user_id.into_inner())
}
```

#### HeaderParam

Extracts a specific value from the request headers.

```rust
#[handler]
fn get_user_from_header(user_id: HeaderParam<i64,true>) -> String {
    format!("User ID from Header: {}", user_id.into_inner())
}
```

#### PathParam

Extracts parameters from the URL path.

```rust
#[handler]
fn get_user(id: PathParam<i64>) -> String {
    format!("User ID from Path: {}", id.into_inner())
}
```

#### QueryParam

Extracts parameters from the URL query string.

```rust
#[handler]
fn search_user(id: QueryParam<i64,true>) -> String {
    format!("Searching for user with ID: {}", id.into_inner())
}
```

### Advanced Usage

You can merge multiple data sources to parse a specific type. First, define a custom type, for example:

```rust
#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Extractible, Debug)]
/// By default, gets field values from the body.
#[salvo(extract(default_source(from = "body")))]
struct GoodMan<'a> {
    /// The id is obtained from the request path parameters and automatically parsed as i64.
    #[salvo(extract(source(from = "param")))]
    id: i64,
    /// Reference types can be used to avoid memory copying.
    username: &'a str,
    first_name: String,
    last_name: String,
}
```

Then in a `Handler`, you can get the data like this:

```rust
#[handler]
async fn edit(req: &mut Request) {
    let good_man: GoodMan<'_> = req.extract().await.unwrap();
}
```

You can even pass the type directly as a function parameter, like this:

```rust
#[handler]
async fn edit<'a>(good_man: GoodMan<'a>) {
    res.render(Json(good_man));
}
```

Data type definitions offer considerable flexibility, even allowing parsing into nested structures as needed:

```rust
#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Extractible, Debug)]
#[salvo(extract(default_source(from = "body")))]
struct GoodMan<'a> {
    #[salvo(extract(source(from = "param")))]
    id: i64,
    #[salvo(extract(source(from = "query")))]
    username: &'a str,
    first_name: String,
    last_name: String,
    lovers: Vec<String>,
    /// This nested field is parsed entirely from the Request again.
    #[salvo(extract(flatten))]
    nested: Nested<'a>,
}

#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Extractible, Debug)]
#[salvo(extract(default_source(from = "body")))]
struct Nested<'a> {
    #[salvo(extract(source(from = "param")))]
    id: i64,
    #[salvo(extract(source(from = "query")))]
    username: &'a str,
    first_name: String,
    last_name: String,
    #[salvo(extract(rename = "lovers"))]
    #[serde(default)]
    pets: Vec<String>,
}
```

For a concrete example, see: [extract-nested](https://github.com/salvo-rs/salvo/blob/main/examples/extract-nested/src/main.rs).

### `#[salvo(extract(flatten))]` VS `#[serde(flatten)]`

If in the above example Nested\<'a> does not have fields with the same names as the parent, you can use `#[serde(flatten)]`. Otherwise, you need to use `#[salvo(extract(flatten))]`.

### `#[salvo(extract(source(parse)))]`

You can also add a `parse` parameter to `source` to specify a particular parsing method. If this parameter is not specified, parsing is determined based on the `Request` information. For a `Form` body, it's parsed as `MultiMap`; for a JSON payload, it's parsed as JSON. Generally, you don't need to specify this parameter. In rare cases, specifying it can enable special functionality.

```rust
#[tokio::test]
async fn test_de_request_with_form_json_str() {
    #[derive(Deserialize, Eq, PartialEq, Debug)]
    struct User<'a> {
        name: &'a str,
        age: usize,
    }
    #[derive(Deserialize, Extractible, Eq, PartialEq, Debug)]
    #[salvo(extract(default_source(from = "body", parse = "json")))]
    struct RequestData<'a> {
        #[salvo(extract(source(from = "param")))]
        p2: &'a str,
        user: User<'a>,
    }
    let mut req = TestClient::get("http://127.0.0.1:8698/test/1234/param2v")
        .raw_form(r#"user={"name": "chris", "age": 20}"#)
        .build();
    req.params.insert("p2".into(), "921".into());
    let data: RequestData = req.extract().await.unwrap();
    assert_eq!(
        data,
        RequestData {
            p2: "921",
            user: User { name: "chris", age: 20 }
        }
    );
}
```

For instance, here the actual request sends a Form, but the value of a certain field is a piece of JSON text. By specifying `parse`, this string can be parsed in JSON format.

# Response

In a `Handler`, the [`Response`](https://docs.rs/salvo_core/latest/salvo_core/http/response/struct.Response.html) is passed as a parameter:

- The `Response` struct encapsulates all components of an HTTP response, providing a comprehensive API for constructing and manipulating HTTP responses.
- It supports a fluent, chainable style (e.g., `res.status_code(200).body("Hello")`), facilitating the smooth construction of responses.
- Core functionalities include:
  - Setting status codes and headers
  - Manipulating the response body (supporting strings, bytes, files, and streaming data)
  - Managing Cookies
  - Multiple content rendering methods
- This struct employs a mutable reference pattern, returning a reference to itself via `&mut self`, allowing handlers to conveniently build and customize HTTP responses to meet various web service requirements.

```rust
#[handler]
async fn hello_world(res: &mut Response) {
    res.render("Hello world!");
}
```

After the server receives a client request, any matched `Handler` or middleware can write data into the `Response`. In certain scenarios, such as when a middleware wishes to prevent the execution of subsequent middleware and `Handler`s, you can use `FlowCtrl`:

```rust
#[handler]
async fn hello_world(res: &mut Response, ctrl: &mut FlowCtrl) {
    ctrl.skip_rest();
    res.render("Hello world!");
}
```

## Writing Content

Writing data to a `Response` is straightforward:

- Writing plain text data

  ```rust
  res.render("Hello world!");
  ```

- Writing JSON serialized data

  ```rust
  use serde::Serialize;
  use salvo::prelude::Json;

  #[derive(Serialize, Debug)]
  struct User {
      name: String,
  }
  let user = User{name: "jobs".to_string()};
  res.render(Json(user));
  ```

:::warning
If the `render` method is called multiple times to write JSON data, these pieces of data will not be merged into a single JSON object. Instead, they will be concatenated sequentially as independent text fragments, potentially resulting in invalid JSON format. If multiple data items need to be returned, they should be combined into a single object before serialization, or the logic should be handled manually.
:::

- Writing HTML

  ```rust
  res.render(Text::Html("<html><body>hello</body></html>"));
  ```

## Writing HTTP Errors

- Using `render` allows writing detailed error information to the `Response`.

  ```rust
  use salvo::http::errors::*;
  res.render(StatusError::internal_server_error().brief("error when serialize object to json"))
  ```

- If custom error information is not needed, you can directly call `set_http_code`.

  ```rust
  use salvo::http::StatusCode;
  res.status_code(StatusCode::BAD_REQUEST);
  ```

## Redirecting to Another URL

- Using the `render` method, you can write a redirect response to the `Response`, navigating to a new URL. When you call `Redirect::found`, it sets the HTTP status code to 302 (Found), indicating a temporary redirect.
  ```rust
  use salvo::prelude::*;

  #[handler]
  async fn redirect(res: &mut Response) {
      res.render(Redirect::found("https://salvo.rs/"));
  }
  ```

## ResBody

The Body type returned by Response is `ResBody`, which is an enum. In case of an error, it is set to `ResBody::Error`, containing error information for deferred error handling. Notably, `StatusError` does not implement `Writer`; this design allows you to customize its display in the `Catcher`.

# Depot

[Depot](https://docs.rs/salvo_core/latest/salvo_core/struct.Depot.html) is used to store temporary data involved in a single request. Middleware can place the temporary data it processes into the Depot for use by subsequent programs.

When a server receives a request from a client browser, it creates an instance of `Depot`. This instance is destroyed after all middleware and `Handler` have finished processing the request.

For example, we can set `current_user` in a login middleware and then read the current user information in subsequent middleware or `Handler`.

## Quick Understanding

`Depot` is used to store and share data during request processing. It implements a type-safe data container that supports two main usage patterns:

1. **Key-Value Storage**: Access values associated with string keys via `insert`/`get` methods.
2. **Type Injection**: Store and retrieve values based on type via `inject`/`obtain` methods.

As shown in the examples, `Depot` is particularly useful for passing data between middleware and handlers. Middleware can set values in `Depot` (such as user information, authentication status), and subsequent handlers can retrieve these values without redundant calculations or queries. The design of `Depot` ensures data consistency and accessibility throughout the entire request processing chain, making it a core tool for building complex web applications.


**main.rs**

```rust file="<root>/codes/use-depot/src/main.rs"
use salvo::prelude::*;

#[handler]
async fn set_user(depot: &mut Depot) {
    depot.insert("user", "client");
}
#[handler]
async fn hello(depot: &mut Depot) -> String {
    format!(
        "Hello {}",
        depot.get::<&str>("user").copied().unwrap_or_default()
    )
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    tracing_subscriber::fmt().init();

    let router = Router::new().hoop(set_user).goal(hello);

    let acceptor = TcpListener::new("0.0.0.0:8698").bind().await;
    Server::new(acceptor).serve(router).await;
}

```


**Cargo.toml**

```toml file="<root>/codes/use-depot/Cargo.toml"
[package]
name = "example-use-depot"
version.workspace = true
edition.workspace = true
publish.workspace = true
rust-version.workspace = true

[dependencies]
salvo = { workspace = true }
tokio = { workspace = true, features = ["macros"] }
tracing.workspace = true
tracing-subscriber.workspace = true

```


## Setting and Retrieving Data via `insert` and `get`

As shown above, you can insert `key` and `value` into `Depot` using `insert`. For values of this type, you can directly retrieve them using `get`.

```rust
depot.insert("a", "b");
assert_eq!(depot.get::<&str>("a").copied().unwrap(), "b")
```

If the `key` does not exist, or if the `key` exists but the type does not match, it returns `None`.

## Setting and Retrieving Data via `inject` and `obtain`

Sometimes, there are scenarios where a unique instance exists for a type without needing to relate to a specific `key`. You can use `inject` to insert data and then use `obtain` to retrieve it. These methods do not require you to provide a `key`.

```rust
depot.inject(Config::new());
depot.obtain::<Config>();
```

# Handler

## Quick Overview

Handler is a core concept in the Salvo framework, which can be simply understood as a request processing unit. It has two main purposes:

1. **As an Endpoint**: An object implementing `Handler` can be placed into the routing system as the final endpoint to process requests. When using the `#[handler]` macro, a function can be directly used as an endpoint; while using the `#[endpoint]` macro not only allows it to serve as an endpoint but also automatically generates OpenAPI documentation (this will be detailed in subsequent documentation).

2. **As Middleware**: The same `Handler` can also be used as middleware to process requests before or after they reach the final endpoint.

Salvo's request processing flow can be viewed as a "pipeline": a request first passes through a series of middleware (vertical processing) and then reaches the matching endpoint (horizontal processing). Both middleware and endpoints are implementations of `Handler`, which ensures consistency and flexibility throughout the system.

### Middleware and the Onion Model

The essence of the onion model is that by placing `ctrl.call_next()` before and after specific logic, it implements a bidirectional processing flow for requests and responses, allowing each middleware to participate in the complete request-response cycle.

### Complete Middleware Example Structure

```rust
async fn example_middleware(req: &mut Request, depot: &mut Depot, resp: &mut Response, ctrl: &mut FlowCtrl) {
    // Pre-processing (Request Phase)
    // Place logic to execute when the request enters here.

    // Call the next handler in the chain.
    ctrl.call_next(req, depot, resp).await;

    // Post-processing (Response Phase)
    // Place logic to execute after the request is processed here.
}
```

## What is a Handler

A Handler is the concrete object responsible for processing Request objects. Handler itself is a Trait containing an asynchronous `handle` method:

```rust
#[async_trait]
pub trait Handler: Send + Sync + 'static {
    async fn handle(&self, req: &mut Request, depot: &mut Depot, res: &mut Response);
}
```

The default signature of the `handle` function includes four parameters, in order: `&mut Request, &mut Depot, &mut Response, &mut FlowCtrl`. Depot is temporary storage that can hold data related to the current request.

Depending on how it's used, it can serve as middleware (hoop), which can perform processing before or after the request reaches the formal request-processing `Handler`, such as: login verification, data compression, etc.

Middleware is added via the `hoop` function of a `Router`. The added middleware affects the current `Router` and all its descendant `Router`s.

A `Handler` can also be used as a `Handler` that participates in route matching and is ultimately executed, known as a `goal`.

## `Handler` as Middleware (hoop)

When a `Handler` acts as middleware, it can be added to the following three types of objects that support middleware:

- `Service`: Any request will pass through the middleware in the `Service`.
- `Router`: Only when route matching succeeds will the request pass through the middleware defined in the `Service` and all middleware collected along the matching path.
- `Catcher`: When an error occurs and no custom error information has been written, the request will pass through the middleware in the `Catcher`.
- `Handler`: The `Handler` itself supports adding middleware wrappers to execute some pre- or post-logic.

## Using the `#[handler]` Macro

The `#[handler]` macro can greatly simplify code writing and improve code flexibility.

It can be applied to a function to make it implement `Handler`:

```rust
#[handler]
async fn hello() -> &'static str {
    "hello world!"
}
```

This is equivalent to:

```rust
struct hello;

#[async_trait]
impl Handler for hello {
    async fn handle(&self, _req: &mut Request, _depot: &mut Depot, res: &mut Response, _ctrl: &mut FlowCtrl) {
        res.render(Text::Plain("hello world!"));
    }
}
```

As you can see, with `#[handler]`, the code becomes much simpler:

- No need to manually add `#[async_trait]`.
- Unnecessary parameters in the function are omitted, and the required parameters can be arranged in any order.
- For objects implementing the `Writer` or `Scribe` abstractions, they can be directly returned as the function's return value. Here, `&'static str` implements `Scribe`, so it can be directly returned.

`#[handler]` can not only be applied to functions but also to the `impl` block of a `struct` to make the `struct` implement `Handler`. In this case, the `handle` function within the `impl` block is recognized as the concrete implementation of the `handle` method in `Handler`:

```rust
struct Hello;

#[handler]
impl Hello {
    async fn handle(&self, res: &mut Response) {
        res.render(Text::Plain("hello world!"));
    }
}
```

## Handling Errors

In Salvo, a `Handler` can return a `Result`, provided that both the `Ok` and `Err` types within the `Result` implement the `Writer` trait.
Considering the widespread use of anyhow, when the `anyhow` feature is enabled, `anyhow::Error` will implement the `Writer` trait. `anyhow::Error` will be mapped to `InternalServerError`.

```rust
#[cfg(feature = "anyhow")]
#[async_trait]
impl Writer for ::anyhow::Error {
    async fn write(mut self, _req: &mut Request, _depot: &mut Depot, res: &mut Response) {
        res.render(StatusError::internal_server_error());
    }
}
```

For custom error types, you can output different error pages as needed.

```rust
use salvo::anyhow;
use salvo::prelude::*;

struct CustomError;
#[async_trait]
impl Writer for CustomError {
    async fn write(mut self, _req: &mut Request, _depot: &mut Depot, res: &mut Response) {
        res.status_code(StatusCode::INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR);
        res.render("custom error");
    }
}

#[handler]
async fn handle_anyhow() -> Result<(), anyhow::Error> {
    Err(anyhow::anyhow!("anyhow error"))
}
#[handler]
async fn handle_custom() -> Result<(), CustomError> {
    Err(CustomError)
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    let router = Router::new()
        .push(Router::new().path("anyhow").get(handle_anyhow))
        .push(Router::new().path("custom").get(handle_custom));
    let acceptor = TcpListener::new("127.0.0.1:8698").bind().await;
    Server::new(acceptor).serve(router).await;
}
```

## Directly Implementing the Handler Trait

```rust
use salvo_core::prelude::*;
use crate::salvo_core::http::Body;

pub struct MaxSizeHandler(u64);
#[async_trait]
impl Handler for MaxSizeHandler {
    async fn handle(&self, req: &mut Request, depot: &mut Depot, res: &mut Response, ctrl: &mut FlowCtrl) {
        if let Some(upper) = req.body().and_then(|body| body.size_hint().upper()) {
            if upper > self.0 {
                res.render(StatusError::payload_too_large());
                ctrl.skip_rest();
            } else {
                ctrl.call_next(req, depot, res).await;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

url: /guide/concepts/catcher.md

# Catcher

When a `Response` returns an error status code and the `Body` within the page is empty, Salvo will attempt to catch this error using a `Catcher` and display a user-friendly error page.

You can obtain a system-default `Catcher` by calling `Catcher::default()`, and then add it to the `Service`.

```rust
use salvo::catcher::Catcher;

Service::new(router).catcher(Catcher::default());
```

The default `Catcher` supports sending error pages in `XML`, `JSON`, `HTML`, and `Text` formats.

You can add custom error-catching handlers to the `Catcher` by attaching `hoop`s to this default `Catcher`. These error-catching handlers are still of type `Handler`.

You can add multiple custom error-catching handlers to the `Catcher` via `hoop`s. Custom error handlers can call the `FlowCtrl::skip_next` method after processing an error to skip subsequent error handlers and return early.


**main.rs**

```rust file="<root>/codes/custom-error-page/src/main.rs"
use salvo::catcher::Catcher;
use salvo::prelude::*;

// Handler that returns a simple "Hello World" response
#[handler]
async fn hello() -> &'static str {
    "Hello World"
}

// Handler that deliberately returns a 500 Internal Server Error
#[handler]
async fn error500(res: &mut Response) {
    res.status_code(StatusCode::INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR);
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    // Initialize logging system
    tracing_subscriber::fmt().init();

    // Create and start server with custom error handling
    let acceptor = TcpListener::new("0.0.0.0:8698").bind().await;
    Server::new(acceptor).serve(create_service()).await;
}

// Create service with custom error handling
fn create_service() -> Service {
    // Set up router with two endpoints:
    // - / : Returns "Hello World"
    // - /500 : Triggers a 500 error
    let router = Router::new()
        .get(hello)
        .push(Router::with_path("500").get(error500));

    // Add custom error catcher for 404 Not Found errors
    Service::new(router).catcher(Catcher::default().hoop(handle404))
}

// Custom handler for 404 Not Found errors
#[handler]
async fn handle404(&self, _req: &Request, _depot: &Depot, res: &mut Response, ctrl: &mut FlowCtrl) {
    // Check if the error is a 404 Not Found
    if StatusCode::NOT_FOUND == res.status_code.unwrap_or(StatusCode::NOT_FOUND) {
        // Return custom error page
        res.render("Custom 404 Error Page");
        // Skip remaining error handlers
        ctrl.skip_rest();
    }
}

```

# Writer

`Writer` is used to write content into `Response`:

```rust
#[async_trait]
pub trait Writer {
    async fn write(mut self, req: &mut Request, depot: &mut Depot, res: &mut Response);
}
```

Compared to Handler:

```rust
#[async_trait]
pub trait Handler: Send + Sync + 'static {
    async fn handle(&self, req: &mut Request, depot: &mut Depot, res: &mut Response, ctrl: &mut FlowCtrl);
}
```

The main differences between them are:

- Different purposes: `Writer` represents writing specific content into `Response`, implemented by concrete content such as strings, error messages, etc. In contrast, `Handler` is used to process the entire request.
- `Writer` is created within a `Handler` and consumes itself when the `write` function is called, making it a one-time call. On the other hand, `Handler` is shared across all requests.
- `Writer` can be returned as the content in the `Result` of a `Handler`.
- `Writer` does not include a `FlowCtrl` parameter, so it cannot control the execution flow of the entire request.

`Scribe` implements `Writer` but offers fewer capabilities compared to `Writer`:

```rust
pub trait Scribe {
    fn render(self, res: &mut Response);
}
```

The rendering function of `Scribe` only writes data into `Response` and cannot retrieve information from `Request` or `Depot` during this process.

# Processing Flow

`Service` first converts the request into Salvo's `Response`, then enters the routing matching phase.

## Routing Matching Phase

Routing matching runs filters in the order they were added, proceeding from outer to inner and top to bottom. If any filter fails, the match is considered unsuccessful.

During the matching process, the request's path information is consumed progressively. Once a path filter matches successfully, it consumes the matched portion of the path. When all path segments are consumed, and no filter fails along the matching chain, and the last `Router` on the current chain has a `goal` `Handler`, the match is successful, and the matching phase ends. All `Handler`s collected from the matching chain proceed to the execution phase.

If the path is not fully consumed, no errors occur along the chain, but there are no further child routes to continue matching, the current chain is considered a match failure, and the process moves to the next route for matching.

If all routes are matched without success, the process enters the error-catching phase.

## Handler Execution Phase

The `Handler`s collected during the matching phase are executed sequentially. During execution, preceding middleware can call `ctrl::call_next()` to allow subsequent middleware to execute first before running its own logic. If an error status code or a redirect occurs during execution, subsequent `Handler`s will not be executed. If the status code indicates an error and the `Response`'s `Body` is unset or is `ResBody::Error`, the process enters the error-catching phase; otherwise, it skips the catching phase.

## Error-Catching Phase

`Catcher` is a type used to handle errors and can also include middleware (hoops). Errors pass through all `Handler`s within the `Catcher` sequentially. If a `Handler` has already handled the error and does not want subsequent `Handler`s to continue, it can skip the rest using `ctrl.skip_rest()`, directly ending the catching phase.

`Catcher` must include at least one `Handler` as the default error handler. The default is `DefaultGoal`, but you can fully customize your own `Handler` as the default error-handling implementation. It displays error information in the format requested by the `content-type` header, supporting `json`, `xml`, `text`, and `html` formats. `DefaultGoal` also provides display settings; for example, by default, it displays Salvo-related links when showing HTML format. You can call `DefaultGoal::footer` or `DefaultGoal::with_footer` to set a custom footer as desired.

`Service` converts Salvo's `Response` into Hyper's `Response` type, which is ultimately returned to clients such as browsers.

# Error Handling

## Common Error Handling Approaches in Rust Applications

Error handling in Rust differs from languages like Java; it lacks constructs like `try...catch`. The typical approach is to define a global error handling type at the application level:

```rust
use thiserror::Error;

#[derive(Error, Debug)]
pub enum AppError {
    #[error("io: `{0}`")]
    Io(#[from] io::Error),
    #[error("utf8: `{0}`")]
    FromUtf8(#[from] FromUtf8Error),
    #[error("diesel: `{0}`")]
    Diesel(#[from] diesel::result::Error),
    ...
}

pub type AppResult<T> = Result<T, AppError>;
```

Here, the `thiserror` library is used, which facilitates defining custom error types and simplifies code. For brevity, an `AppResult` type alias is also defined.

### thiserror vs. anyhow

In the Rust error handling ecosystem, two commonly used libraries are `thiserror` and `anyhow`:

- **thiserror**: Suitable for library developers to define clear error types. It uses derive macros to help implement the `std::error::Error` trait for custom error types while allowing you to define error representations. When building a library or providing clear error types to users, `thiserror` is the better choice.

- **anyhow**: Geared toward application developers, it provides a generic error type `anyhow::Error` that can encapsulate any error implementing the `std::error::Error` trait. It focuses more on error propagation than definition, making it particularly suitable for application-layer code. You can quickly convert various errors into `anyhow::Error`, reducing the need for boilerplate code.

In some scenarios, you might use both libraries: define error types with `thiserror` in libraries and handle and propagate these errors with `anyhow` in applications.

## Error Handling in Handlers

In Salvo, `Handler`s often encounter various errors, such as database connection errors, file access errors, network connection errors, etc. For these types of errors, the aforementioned error handling approach can be applied:

```rust
#[handler]
async fn home() -> AppResult<()> {

}
```

Here, `home` directly returns an `AppResult<()>`. But how should this error be displayed? We need to implement the `Writer` trait for the custom error type `AppResult`, where we can decide how to display the error:

```rust
#[async_trait]
impl Writer for AppError {
    async fn write(mut self, _req: &mut Request, depot: &mut Depot, res: &mut Response) {
        res.render(Text::Plain("I'm a error, hahaha!"));
    }
}
```

In Salvo, a `Handler` can return a `Result`, provided that both the `Ok` and `Err` types in the `Result` implement the `Writer` trait.

### Error Handling with anyhow

Given the widespread use of anyhow, Salvo provides built-in support for `anyhow::Error`. When the `anyhow` feature is enabled, `anyhow::Error` implements the `Writer` trait and is mapped to `InternalServerError`:

```rust
#[cfg(feature = "anyhow")]
#[async_trait]
impl Writer for ::anyhow::Error {
    async fn write(mut self, _req: &mut Request, _depot: &mut Depot, res: &mut Response) {
        res.render(StatusError::internal_server_error());
    }
}
```

To use the anyhow feature, enable Salvo's `anyhow` feature in Cargo.toml:

```toml
[dependencies]
salvo = { version = "*", features = ["anyhow"] }
anyhow = "1.0"
```

This allows your handler functions to directly return `anyhow::Result<T>`:

```rust
#[handler]
async fn home() -> anyhow::Result<impl Writer> {
    let data = fetch_data().context("Failed to fetch data")?;
    Ok(Text::Plain(data))
}
```

Errors often contain sensitive information, which generally shouldn't be visible to regular users for security and privacy reasons. However, if you're a developer or site administrator, you might prefer errors to be fully exposed, revealing the most accurate error information.

As shown, in the `write` method, we can access references to `Request` and `Depot`, making it convenient to implement the above approach:

```rust
#[async_trait]
impl Writer for AppError {
    async fn write(mut self, _req: &mut Request, depot: &mut Depot, res: &mut Response) {
        let user = depot.obtain::<User>();
        if user.is_admin {
            res.render(Text::Plain(e.to_string()));
        } else {
            res.render(Text::Plain("I'm a error, hahaha!"));
        }
    }
}
```

## Displaying Error Pages

Salvo's built-in error pages meet requirements in most cases, displaying Html, Json, or Xml pages based on the request's data type. However, there are situations where custom error page displays are still desired.

This can be achieved by implementing a custom `Catcher`. For detailed instructions, refer to the [`Catcher`](/guide/concepts/catcher.md) section.

# Sending Files

Salvo can send files in several ways:

### NamedFile

Salvo provides `salvo::fs::NamedFile`, which can be used to efficiently send files to clients. It does not load the entire file into memory; instead, it reads and sends only the portions requested by the client based on the `Range` header.

In practice, using `Response::send_file` is a simplified way to utilize `NamedFile`. If you need more control over file delivery, you can use `NamedFileBuilder`.

You can create a `NamedFileBuilder` via `NamedFile::builder`:

```rust
#[handler]
async fn send_file(req: &mut Request, res: &mut Response) {
    let builder = NamedFile::builder("/file/to/path");
}
```

After configuring the builder, you can send the file:

```rust
#[handler]
async fn send_file(req: &mut Request, res: &mut Response) {
    NamedFile::builder("/file/to/path").attached_name("image.png").send(req.headers(), res).await;
}
```

### Serve Static

Middleware for serving static files or embedded files.

- `StaticDir` provides support for serving static files from local directories. You can pass a list of multiple directories as arguments. For example:


**main.rs**

```rust file="<root>/codes/static-dir-list/src/main.rs"
use salvo::prelude::*;
use salvo::serve_static::StaticDir;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    tracing_subscriber::fmt().init();

    let router = Router::with_path("{*path}").get(
        StaticDir::new([
            "static-dir-list/static/boy",
            "static-dir-list/static/girl",
            "static/boy",
            "static/girl",
        ])
        .include_dot_files(false)
        .defaults("index.html")
        .auto_list(true),
    );

    let acceptor = TcpListener::new("0.0.0.0:8698").bind().await;
    Server::new(acceptor).serve(router).await;
}

```


**Cargo.toml**

```toml file="<root>/codes/static-dir-list/Cargo.toml"
[package]
name = "example-static-dir-list"
version.workspace = true
edition.workspace = true
publish.workspace = true
rust-version.workspace = true

[dependencies]
salvo = { workspace = true, features = ["serve-static"] }
tokio = { workspace = true, features = ["macros"] }
tracing.workspace = true
tracing-subscriber.workspace = true

```


If a file is not found in the first directory, it will be searched for in the second directory.

- Provides support for `rust-embed`. For example:


**main.rs**

```rust file="<root>/codes/static-embed-files/src/main.rs"
use rust_embed::RustEmbed;
use salvo::prelude::*;
use salvo::serve_static::static_embed;

#[derive(RustEmbed)]
#[folder = "static"]
struct Assets;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    tracing_subscriber::fmt().init();

    let router = Router::with_path("{*path}").get(static_embed::<Assets>().fallback("index.html"));

    let acceptor = TcpListener::new("0.0.0.0:8698").bind().await;
    Server::new(acceptor).serve(router).await;
}

```


**Cargo.toml**

```toml file="<root>/codes/static-embed-files/Cargo.toml"
[package]
name = "example-static-embed-files"
version.workspace = true
edition.workspace = true
publish.workspace = true
rust-version.workspace = true

[dependencies]
rust-embed.workspace = true
salvo = { workspace = true, features = ["serve-static"] }
tokio = { workspace = true, features = ["macros"] }
tracing.workspace = true
tracing-subscriber.workspace = true

```


The `with_fallback` method allows you to specify a fallback file to serve when the requested file is not found. This is particularly useful for single-page applications (SPAs).

# Using Template Engines

Salvo does not come with any built-in template engine, as preferences for template engine styles vary from person to person.

At its core, a template engine is simply: data + template = string.

Therefore, as long as the final string can be rendered, any template engine can be supported.

For example, support for `askama`:


**main.rs**

```rust file="<root>/codes/template-askama/src/main.rs"
use askama::Template;
use salvo::prelude::*;

#[derive(Template)]
#[template(path = "hello.html")]
struct HelloTemplate<'a> {
    name: &'a str,
}

#[handler]
async fn hello(req: &mut Request, res: &mut Response) {
    let hello_tmpl = HelloTemplate {
        name: req.param::<&str>("name").unwrap_or("World"),
    };
    res.render(Text::Html(hello_tmpl.render().unwrap()));
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    tracing_subscriber::fmt().init();

    let router = Router::with_path("{name}").get(hello);
    let acceptor = TcpListener::new("0.0.0.0:8698").bind().await;
    Server::new(acceptor).serve(router).await;
}

```


**Cargo.toml**

```toml file="<root>/codes/template-askama/Cargo.toml"
[package]
name = "example-template-askama"
version.workspace = true
edition.workspace = true
publish.workspace = true
rust-version.workspace = true

[dependencies]
askama = "0.11"
salvo = { workspace = true }
tokio = { workspace = true, features = ["macros"] }
tracing.workspace = true
tracing-subscriber.workspace = true

```


**templates/hello.html**

```html file="<root>/codes/template-askama/templates/hello.html"
Hello, {{ name }}!
```


**Note**: For projects that are not particularly complex, we highly recommend adopting a frontend-backend separation approach. Use more flexible and ecosystem-rich UI frameworks (such as React, Vue, Svelte, etc.) to build the frontend, with Salvo serving as the backend API service. This approach leads to higher development efficiency, clearer responsibilities between frontend and backend, and better aligns with modern web application development trends.

# Graceful Shutdown

Graceful shutdown refers to the process where, when a server is being shut down, it does not immediately terminate all connections. Instead, it first stops accepting new requests while allowing existing requests sufficient time to complete their processing before closing the service. This approach prevents requests from being abruptly interrupted, thereby improving user experience and system reliability.

Salvo provides support for graceful shutdown through the `handle` method of the `Server`, which retrieves the server handle, followed by calling the `stop_graceful` method to implement the shutdown. After invoking this method, the server will:

- Stop accepting new connection requests
- Wait for existing requests to complete processing
- Forcefully close any remaining connections after a specified timeout (if provided)

Here is a simple example:

```rust
use salvo_core::prelude::*;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    let acceptor = TcpListener::new("127.0.0.1:8698").bind().await;
    let server = Server::new(acceptor);
    let handle = server.handle();

    // Gracefully shut down the server
    tokio::spawn(async move {
        tokio::time::sleep(std::time::Duration::from_secs(60)).await;
        handle.stop_graceful(None);
    });
    server.serve(Router::new()).await;
}
```

In the example above:

- `server.handle()` retrieves the server handle, which can be used to control the server's lifecycle
- `handle.stop_graceful(None)` initiates the graceful shutdown process, where `None` indicates no timeout is set, meaning the server will wait indefinitely for all requests to complete
- To set a timeout, you can pass `Some(Duration)`, after which any remaining connections will be forcefully closed

This approach is particularly suitable for applications deployed in container environments or on cloud platforms, as well as for scenarios requiring hot updates to ensure that requests are not unexpectedly interrupted.

# Writing Tests

## The Importance of Testing

Writing tests is a hallmark of responsible engineering and the secret to sleeping soundly. A comprehensive test suite not only improves code quality and prevents regression errors but also ensures you rest easy after deployment. While your colleagues might be jolted awake by late-night system crash alerts, your application remains rock-solid—this is the tranquility and confidence that testing brings.

## Salvo Testing Tools

The test module provided by Salvo helps you test Salvo-based projects.

[Latest Documentation](https://docs.rs/salvo_core/latest/salvo_core/test/index.html)

**Simple Example:**

```rust
use salvo::prelude::*;

#[handler]
async fn hello_world() -> &'static str {
    "Hello World"
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    tracing_subscriber::fmt().init();

    tracing::info!("Listening on http://127.0.0.1:8698");
    let acceptor = TcpListener::new("127.0.0.1:8698").bind().await; Server::new(acceptor).serve(route()).await;
}

fn route() -> Router {
    Router::new().get(hello_world)
}

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use salvo::prelude::*;
    use salvo::test::{ResponseExt, TestClient};

    #[tokio::test]
    async fn test_hello_world() {
        let service = Service::new(super::route());

        let content = TestClient::get(format!("http://127.0.0.1:8698/"))
            .send(&service)
            .await
            .take_string()
            .await
            .unwrap();
        assert_eq!(content, "Hello World");
    }
}
```

# How to Deploy Applications

A Salvo project, after compilation, becomes an executable file. For deployment, you only need to upload this executable along with its dependent static resources to the server.

For Rust-based projects, there is also a very simple deployment platform: [shuttle.rs](https://www.shuttle.rs). Shuttle provides support for Salvo-like projects. For details, please refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.shuttle.rs/guide/salvo-examples.html).

## Docker Deployment

You can also use Docker to deploy Salvo applications. Below is a basic `Dockerfile` example, which you can adjust according to your project's requirements:

```dockerfile
# Build stage
FROM rust:slim AS build
WORKDIR /app

# Copy dependency files first to build dependencies (leveraging cache layers)
COPY Cargo.toml Cargo.lock ./
RUN mkdir src && \
    echo 'fn main() { println!("Placeholder"); }' > src/main.rs && \
    cargo build --release

# Copy actual source code and build the application
COPY src ./src/
RUN touch src/main.rs && \
    cargo build --release

# Use a lightweight base image for the runtime stage
FROM debian:bookworm-slim
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends ca-certificates && \
    apt-get clean && \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Create a non-root user to run the application
RUN useradd -ms /bin/bash appuser
USER appuser
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the binary file from the build stage
COPY --from=build /app/target/release/your_app_name ./app

# Set the container startup command
CMD ["./app"]
```

### Usage Instructions

1. Save the above `Dockerfile` in your project's root directory.
2. Adjust `your_app_name` to the actual binary file name according to your project.
3. If your application requires static files (such as templates, CSS, JS, etc.), you can add corresponding `COPY` commands.
4. If your application requires environment variable configuration, you can use the `ENV` instruction.
5. Build the Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t your-app-name .
   ```
6. Run the container:
   ```bash
   docker run -p 8698:8698 your-app-name
   ```

Please adjust the port number and other configurations according to your application's actual needs.

# HTTP/3 Support

Salvo provides support for HTTP/3, which can be enabled via the `quinn` feature. HTTP/3 is based on the QUIC protocol and offers lower latency and better performance compared to traditional HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2, especially in unstable network environments.

## Enabling HTTP/3 Support

To enable HTTP/3 support in Salvo, you need to activate the `quinn` feature in your `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
salvo = { workspace = true, features = ["quinn"] }
```

## HTTP/3 Use Cases

HTTP/3 is particularly suitable for the following scenarios:

- Applications on mobile devices and in unstable network environments
- Real-time applications requiring low latency
- Scenarios involving parallel downloads of numerous small files
- Applications needing connection migration (e.g., seamless switching from WiFi to cellular networks without connection interruption)

## Example Code

The following is a simple HTTP/3 server example that supports both HTTP/3 (QUIC) and HTTPS (TCP):

```rust
use salvo::conn::rustls::{Keycert, RustlsConfig};
use salvo::prelude::*;

// Handler function that responds with "Hello World"
#[handler]
async fn hello() -> &'static str {
    "Hello World"
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    // Initialize the logging system
    tracing_subscriber::fmt().init();

    // Load TLS certificate and private key from embedded PEM files
    let cert = include_bytes!("../certs/cert.pem").to_vec();
    let key = include_bytes!("../certs/key.pem").to_vec();

    // Create a router and add an endpoint
    let router = Router::new().get(hello);

    // Configure TLS settings using Rustls
    let config = RustlsConfig::new(Keycert::new().cert(cert.as_slice()).key(key.as_slice()));

    // Create a TLS-encrypted TCP listener on port 8698
    let listener = TcpListener::new(("0.0.0.0", 8698)).rustls(config.clone());

    // Create a QUIC listener and combine it with the TCP listener
    let acceptor = QuinnListener::new(config.build_quinn_config().unwrap(), ("0.0.0.0", 8698))
        .join(listener)
        .bind()
        .await;

    // Start the server supporting both HTTP/3 (QUIC) and HTTPS (TCP)
    Server::new(acceptor).serve(router).await;
}
```

## Key Code Analysis

### TLS Configuration

```rust
// Configure TLS settings using Rustls
let config = RustlsConfig::new(Keycert::new().cert(cert.as_slice()).key(key.as_slice()));
```

Since HTTP/3 is based on the QUIC protocol, which requires TLS 1.3 for encryption, TLS certificates and keys must be configured. In Salvo, we use `RustlsConfig` to configure TLS.

### Combining Listeners

```rust
// Create a TLS-encrypted TCP listener
let listener = TcpListener::new(("0.0.0.0", 8698)).rustls(config.clone());

// Create a QUIC listener and combine it with the TCP listener
let acceptor = QuinnListener::new(config.build_quinn_config().unwrap(), ("0.0.0.0", 8698))
    .join(listener)
    .bind()
    .await;
```

This code is the core part of handling HTTP/3 in Salvo. It first creates a TLS-enabled TCP listener (for HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2), then creates a QUIC listener (for HTTP/3). The `join` method combines these two listeners, enabling the server to handle requests from different protocols simultaneously.

## Running the Example

To run this example, you need valid TLS certificates and private keys. In a development environment, self-signed certificates can be used. The complete example code can be found in the [Salvo GitHub repository](https://github.com/salvo-rs/salvo/tree/main/examples/hello-h3).

Note that since many clients do not yet fully support HTTP/3, it is essential for this server to support both HTTP/3 and HTTPS.

## Considerations

1. HTTP/3 requires TLS 1.3 support, so valid certificates and keys must be configured.
2. Clients must support the HTTP/3 protocol to utilize this feature; otherwise, they will fall back to HTTP/1.1 or HTTP/2.
3. In production environments, certificates issued by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA) should be used instead of self-signed certificates.

# Affix State Shared Data in Requests

The Affix State middleware is used to add shared data to the Depot.
To use the Affix State feature, you need to enable the `affix-state` feature in Cargo.toml.

## Feature Analysis

Affix State provides a simple way to share data during request processing. It allows you to:

- Inject global configurations or shared data during route configuration
- Access this data via the Depot in any handler
- Support any cloneable type as state data

## Comparison with Other Frameworks for Quick Concept Understanding

| Framework           | Language   | State Management Approach                                              |
| ------------------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Salvo (Affix State) | Rust       | Stores and accesses via Depot, supports multiple types                 |
| Axum                | Rust       | Stores state via Extension, similar but with different usage           |
| Actix-web           | Rust       | Uses App Data and Web::Data to share state                             |
| Gin                 | Go         | Uses context.Set and context.Get to store and retrieve data            |
| Echo                | Go         | Uses context.Set and context.Get to manage shared state                |
| Spring              | Java       | Uses ApplicationContext or @Bean annotations for dependency management |
| Quarkus             | Java       | Uses CDI and dependency injection mechanisms                           |
| Express.js          | JavaScript | Uses app.locals or req.app.locals to store global state                |
| Nest.js             | JavaScript | Uses a dependency injection system to manage shared services           |
| Koa.js              | JavaScript | Uses ctx.state to store request-level state                            |

## Common Use Cases

- Database connection pool sharing
- Application configuration sharing
- Cache instance sharing
- API client sharing
- Global counters or state tracking

The advantage of Affix State lies in its simplicity and flexibility, allowing easy sharing of any type of data across different routes and handlers without extensive boilerplate code.
_**Example Code**_


**main.rs**

```rust file="<root>/codes/affix-state/src/main.rs"
use std::sync::Arc;
use std::sync::Mutex;

use salvo::prelude::*;

// Configuration structure with username and password
#[allow(dead_code)]
#[derive(Default, Clone, Debug)]
struct Config {
    username: String,
    password: String,
}

// State structure to hold a list of fail messages
#[derive(Default, Debug)]
struct State {
    fails: Mutex<Vec<String>>,
}

#[handler]
async fn hello(depot: &mut Depot) -> String {
    // Obtain the Config instance from the depot
    let config = depot.obtain::<Config>().unwrap();
    // Get custom data from the depot
    let custom_data = depot.get::<&str>("custom_data").unwrap();
    // Obtain the shared State instance from the depot
    let state = depot.obtain::<Arc<State>>().unwrap();
    // Lock the fails vector and add a new fail message
    let mut fails_ref = state.fails.lock().unwrap();
    fails_ref.push("fail message".into());
    // Format and return the response string
    format!("Hello World\nConfig: {config:#?}\nFails: {fails_ref:#?}\nCustom Data: {custom_data}")
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    // Initialize the tracing subscriber for logging
    tracing_subscriber::fmt().init();

    // Create a Config instance with default username and password
    let config = Config {
        username: "root".to_string(),
        password: "pwd".to_string(),
    };

    // Set up the router with state injection and custom data
    let router = Router::new()
        // Use hoop to inject middleware and data into the request context
        .hoop(
            affix_state::inject(config)
                // Inject a shared State instance into the request context
                .inject(Arc::new(State {
                    fails: Mutex::new(Vec::new()),
                }))
                // Insert custom data into the request context
                .insert("custom_data", "I love this world!"),
        )
        // Register the hello handler for the root path
        .get(hello)
        // Add an additional route for the path "/hello" with the same handler
        .push(Router::with_path("hello").get(hello));

    // Bind the server to port 8698 and start serving
    let acceptor = TcpListener::new("0.0.0.0:8698").bind().await;
    Server::new(acceptor).serve(router).await;
}

# Basic Authentication

A middleware that provides support for Basic Auth.

## Introduction to Basic Auth

Basic Auth is a simple HTTP authentication mechanism that transmits a username and password via the `Authorization` header in HTTP requests. The format is `Authorization: Basic <base64 username:password>`. While simple, since credentials are only Base64-encoded rather than encrypted, it is typically used with HTTPS to ensure security.

## Comparison of Basic Auth Implementations in Common Frameworks

| Framework       | Language   | Basic Auth Implementation                                                        |
| --------------- | ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Salvo           | Rust       | Implemented via the `BasicAuth` middleware and custom `BasicAuthValidator`       |
| Express         | JavaScript | Uses the `express-basic-auth` middleware package                                 |
| Spring Security | Java       | Configured via `httpBasic()` and implemented with `UserDetailsService`           |
| ASP.NET Core    | C#         | Uses `.UseAuthentication()` and `AddAuthentication(AuthenticationSchemes.Basic)` |
| Gin             | Go         | Implemented via custom middleware or using the `gin-contrib/auth` package        |

## Use Cases

Basic Auth is suitable for the following scenarios:

1. **Internal APIs and Tools**: Management tools and APIs used within a company
2. **Development and Testing Environments**: Quickly implement authentication without a complex login system
3. **Simple API Protection**: When a complex user management system is not required
4. **Combined with Other Security Measures**: As part of a multi-layered security architecture

In Salvo, the Basic Auth middleware can be easily integrated into routes. By implementing the `BasicAuthValidator` trait, custom validation logic can be defined, offering great flexibility.

## Considerations

- Always use with HTTPS to protect credential transmission
- Not suitable for production environments storing sensitive information
- Consider using more secure authentication methods such as JWT or OAuth for production environments


**main.rs**

```rust file="<root>/codes/basic-auth/src/main.rs"
use salvo::basic_auth::{BasicAuth, BasicAuthValidator};
use salvo::prelude::*;

// Custom validator implementing BasicAuthValidator trait
struct Validator;
impl BasicAuthValidator for Validator {
    // Validate username and password combination
    async fn validate(&self, username: &str, password: &str, _depot: &mut Depot) -> bool {
        username == "root" && password == "pwd"
    }
}

// Simple handler that returns "Hello" for authenticated requests
#[handler]
async fn hello() -> &'static str {
    "Hello"
}

// Create router with basic authentication middleware
fn route() -> Router {
    // Initialize basic authentication handler with our validator
    let auth_handler = BasicAuth::new(Validator);
    // Apply authentication middleware to the router
    Router::with_hoop(auth_handler).goal(hello)
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    // Initialize logging
    tracing_subscriber::fmt().init();

    // Bind server to port 8698 and start serving
    let acceptor = TcpListener::new("0.0.0.0:8698").bind().await;
    Server::new(acceptor).serve(route()).await;
}

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use salvo::prelude::*;
    use salvo::test::{ResponseExt, TestClient};

    #[tokio::test]
    async fn test_basic_auth() {
        // Create a service instance from our router for testing purposes
        let service = Service::new(super::route());

        // Test case 1: Verify successful authentication with valid credentials
        let content = TestClient::get("http://0.0.0.0:8698/")
            .basic_auth("root", Some("pwd")) // Use correct username/password
            .send(&service) // Send the request to the service
            .await
            .take_string() // Extract response body as string
            .await
            .unwrap();
        // Verify response contains expected "Hello" message
        assert!(content.contains("Hello"));

        // Test case 2: Verify authentication failure with invalid password
        let content = TestClient::get("http://0.0.0.0:8698/")
            .basic_auth("root", Some("pwd2")) // Use incorrect password
            .send(&service) // Send the request to the service
            .await
            .take_string() // Extract response body as string
            .await
            .unwrap();
        // Verify response contains "Unauthorized" error
        assert!(content.contains("Unauthorized"));
    }
}

```

# Cache

Middleware that provides caching functionality.

The Cache middleware can cache the `StatusCode`, `Headers`, and `Body` of a `Response`. For content that has already been cached, the Cache middleware will directly send the cached content from memory to the client when processing subsequent requests.

Note: This plugin does not cache `Response` objects whose `Body` is `ResBody::Stream`. If applied to such a `Response`, Cache will not process these requests, and no error will occur.

## Main Features

- `CacheIssuer` provides an abstraction for generating cache keys. `RequestIssuer` is one of its implementations, allowing you to define which parts of the request URL and the request `Method` should be used to generate the cache key. You can also define your own cache key generation logic. The cache key does not necessarily have to be a string; any type that satisfies the `Hash + Eq + Send + Sync + 'static` constraints can be used as a key.

- `CacheStore` provides operations for storing and retrieving data. `MokaStore` is a built-in memory-based cache implementation based on `moka`. You can also define your own implementation.

- `Cache` is a struct that implements `Handler`. It also contains an internal `skipper` field, which can be used to specify requests that should skip caching. By default, it uses `MethodSkipper` to skip all requests except those with `Method::GET`.

  Example internal implementation code:

  ```rust
  impl<S, I> Cache<S, I> {
    pub fn new(store: S, issuer: I) -> Self {
        let skipper = MethodSkipper::new().skip_all().skip_get(false);
        Cache {
            store,
            issuer,
            skipper: Box::new(skipper),
        }
    }
  }
  ```

## Quick Migration from Other Frameworks

If you have used caching mechanisms in other frameworks, the following conceptual mappings will help you adapt to Salvo's caching implementation more quickly:

### Rust Framework Migration Guide

- **Migrating from Actix-web**: Plugins like `actix-web-cache` in Actix-web typically need to be introduced separately, whereas caching in Salvo is part of the core library.

  ```rust
  // Actix-web cache example
  use actix_web_cache::Cache;
  App::new().wrap(Cache::new().ttl(30))

  // Corresponding Salvo implementation
  use salvo::prelude::*;
  Router::new().hoop(Cache::new(MokaStore::new(100), RequestIssuer::new()))
  ```

### Migration Guide for Frameworks in Other Languages

- **Migrating from Go/Gin**: Gin uses a middleware pattern, which Salvo also adopts in a similar manner:

  ```go
  // Gin cache example
  store := persist.NewMemoryStore(time.Second * 60)
  router.Use(cache.CachePage(store, time.Second * 30))
  ```

  ```rust
  // Corresponding Salvo implementation
  let store = MokaStore::new(100).with_ttl(Duration::from_secs(30));
  router.hoop(Cache::new(store, RequestIssuer::new()))
  ```

- **Migrating from Spring Boot**: Spring Boot's declarative caching needs to be converted to Salvo's explicit middleware configuration:

  ```java
  // Spring Boot
  @Cacheable(value = "books", key = "#isbn")
  public Book findBook(ISBN isbn) { ... }
  ```

  ```rust
  // Corresponding Salvo implementation - applying cache at the route level
  let custom_issuer = YourCustomIssuer::new(); // Implement the CacheIssuer interface
  Router::with_path("books").hoop(Cache::new(MokaStore::new(100), custom_issuer))
  ```

- **Migrating from Express.js**: Express's caching middleware is conceptually similar to Salvo's, but the syntax differs:

  ```javascript
  // Express.js
  const apicache = require('apicache');
  app.use(apicache.middleware('5 minutes'));

  // Corresponding Salvo implementation
  let store = MokaStore::new(100).with_ttl(Duration::from_secs(300));
  router.hoop(Cache::new(store, RequestIssuer::new()))
  ```

When migrating from other frameworks, pay attention to several key concepts of Salvo's caching:

1. **Cache Key Generation** - Controlled via the `CacheIssuer` interface.
2. **Cache Storage** - Implemented via the `CacheStore` interface.
3. **Cache Skipping Logic** - Customized via the `skipper` mechanism.

By default, Salvo only caches GET requests, which aligns with the default behavior of most frameworks.

_**Example Code**_


**main.rs**

```rust file="<root>/codes/cache-simple/src/main.rs"
use std::time::Duration;

use salvo::cache::{Cache, MokaStore, RequestIssuer};
use salvo::prelude::*;
use salvo::writing::Text;
use time::OffsetDateTime;

// Handler for serving the home page with HTML content
#[handler]
async fn home() -> Text<&'static str> {
    Text::Html(HOME_HTML)
}

// Handler for short-lived cached response (5 seconds)
#[handler]
async fn short() -> String {
    format!(
        "Hello World, my birth time is {}",
        OffsetDateTime::now_utc()
    )
}

// Handler for long-lived cached response (1 minute)
#[handler]
async fn long() -> String {
    format!(
        "Hello World, my birth time is {}",
        OffsetDateTime::now_utc()
    )
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    // Initialize logging system
    tracing_subscriber::fmt().init();

    // Create cache middleware for short-lived responses (5 seconds TTL)
    let short_cache = Cache::new(
        MokaStore::builder()
            .time_to_live(Duration::from_secs(5))
            .build(),
        RequestIssuer::default(),
    );

    // Create cache middleware for long-lived responses (60 seconds TTL)
    let long_cache = Cache::new(
        MokaStore::builder()
            .time_to_live(Duration::from_secs(60))
            .build(),
        RequestIssuer::default(),
    );

    // Set up router with three endpoints:
    // - / : Home page
    // - /short : Response cached for 5 seconds
    // - /long : Response cached for 1 minute
    let router = Router::new()
        .get(home)
        .push(Router::with_path("short").hoop(short_cache).get(short))
        .push(Router::with_path("long").hoop(long_cache).get(long));

    // Bind server to port 8698 and start serving
    let acceptor = TcpListener::new("0.0.0.0:8698").bind().await;
    Server::new(acceptor).serve(router).await;

# Caching Headers

A middleware that provides support for configuring caching headers.

Cache control is a crucial part of web performance optimization. By correctly setting caching headers, unnecessary network requests can be reduced, thereby improving application performance. [Cache-Control](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cache-Control) is an HTTP response header used to specify browser caching policies. It controls who can cache responses, under what conditions, and for how long.

Internally, it includes implementations of three `Handler`s: `CachingHeaders`, `Modified`, and `ETag`. `CachingHeaders` is a combination of the latter two. Under normal circumstances, `CachingHeaders` is used.

- `Modified`: Provides cache validation based on the resource's last modified time.
- `ETag`: Uses Entity Tags to offer a more precise resource validation mechanism.
- `CachingHeaders`: Combines the above two mechanisms to provide comprehensive cache control support.

_**Example Code**_


**main.rs**

```rust file="<root>/codes/caching-headers/src/main.rs"
use salvo::prelude::*;

// Handler that returns a simple "Hello World" response
#[handler]
async fn hello() -> &'static str {
    "Hello World"
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    // Initialize logging system
    tracing_subscriber::fmt().init();

    // Set up router with caching headers and compression middleware
    // CachingHeader must be before Compression to properly set cache control headers
    let router = Router::with_hoop(CachingHeaders::new())
        .hoop(Compression::new().min_length(0)) // Enable compression for all responses
        .get(hello);

    // Bind server to port 8698 and start serving
    let acceptor = TcpListener::new("0.0.0.0:8698").bind().await;
    Server::new(acceptor).serve(router).await;
}

```

# Catching Panics in Requests

Catch Panic is used to capture crashes that occur during request processing in the program. For specific APIs, please [refer to the documentation](https://docs.rs/salvo_extra/latest/salvo_extra/catch_panic/index.html).

> **Note**: To use `CatchPanic`, you need to enable the `catch-panic` feature in `Cargo.toml`:
>
> ```toml
> salvo = { version = "xxx", features = ["catch-panic"] }
> ```

## Middleware Introduction

`CatchPanic` is a middleware designed to catch panics in handlers. When a panic occurs during request processing, it captures the panic and writes a 500 Internal Server Error to the response, preventing the entire server from crashing.

**Important Note**: This middleware should be used as the first middleware to ensure it can catch panics from other middlewares or handlers.

## Basic Usage

```rust
use salvo_core::prelude::*;
use salvo_extra::catch_panic::CatchPanic;

#[handler]
async fn hello() {
    panic!("panic error!");
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    let router = Router::new().hoop(CatchPanic::new()).get(hello);
    let acceptor = TcpListener::new("0.0.0.0:8698").bind().await;
    Server::new(acceptor).serve(router).await;
}
```

## Comparison with Other Frameworks for Quick Concept Understanding

### Axum

Similar to the `catch_panic` middleware in Axum's `Tower`:

```rust
use axum::{
    Router,
    routing::get,
    http::StatusCode,
};
use tower::ServiceBuilder;
use tower_http::catch_panic::CatchPanicLayer;

async fn panic_handler() -> &'static str {
    panic!("panic error!");
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    let app = Router::new()
        .route("/", get(panic_handler))
        .layer(
            ServiceBuilder::new()
                .layer(CatchPanicLayer::new())
        );
    
    axum::Server::bind(&"0.0.0.0:3000".parse().unwrap())
        .serve(app.into_make_service())
        .await
        .unwrap();
}
```

### Gin (Go)

In the Go language's Gin framework, similar to the Recovery middleware:

```go
package main

import (
    "github.com/gin-gonic/gin"
)

func main() {
    r := gin.Default() // Includes the Recovery middleware by default
    
    r.GET("/", func(c *gin.Context) {
        panic("panic error!")
    })
    
    r.Run(":8080")
}
```

## Example Code


**main.rs**

# Response Compression

A middleware for compressing the content of `Response`.

Supports three compression formats: `br`, `gzip`, and `deflate`. The priority and configuration of each compression method can be customized as needed.

## Data Compression in HTTP Protocol

1. File format level: Specific file types use dedicated compression algorithms.
2. HTTP protocol level: End-to-end resource compression transmission is achieved through content encoding.
3. Connection level: Data compression is performed between nodes of an HTTP connection.

For more information about HTTP compression, refer to the [Mozilla Developer Network documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/Compression).

## Example Code


**main.rs**

```rust file="<root>/codes/compression/src/main.rs"
use salvo::prelude::*;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    // Initialize logging system
    tracing_subscriber::fmt().init();

    // Print current working directory for debugging
    println!("current_dir: {:?}", std::env::current_dir().unwrap());

    // Set up base directory for static files
    let current_dir = std::env::current_dir().unwrap();
    let base_dir = if !current_dir.to_str().unwrap().ends_with("compression") {
        current_dir
            .join("compression/static")
            .canonicalize()
            .unwrap()
    } else {
        current_dir.join("static").canonicalize().unwrap()
    };
    println!("Base Dir: {base_dir:?}");

    // Configure router with different compression settings for different paths
    let router = Router::new()
        // WebSocket chat with forced compression priority
        .push(
            Router::with_hoop(Compression::new().force_priority(true))
                .path("ws_chat")
                .get(StaticFile::new(base_dir.join("ws_chat.txt"))),
        )
        // SSE chat with Brotli compression
        .push(
            Router::with_hoop(Compression::new().enable_brotli(CompressionLevel::Fastest))

# Concurrency Limitation

The Concurrency Limiter middleware can control the number of concurrent requests. For specific API details, please [refer to the documentation](https://docs.rs/salvo_extra/latest/salvo_extra/concurrency_limiter/index.html).

## Application Scenarios

The concurrency limiter is particularly useful in the following scenarios:

- **High-Traffic Website Protection**: Limits the number of simultaneously processed requests during traffic surges to prevent server overload.
- **Resource-Intensive Operation Control**: Restricts concurrency for resource-intensive operations such as file uploads and database writes.
- **Third-Party API Call Limitation**: Controls concurrent request numbers when calling external services with rate limits.

## Main Functions

- **Prevent Server Overload**: Maintains server stability during traffic peaks by limiting concurrent requests.
- **Enhance System Reliability**: Avoids system crashes caused by resource exhaustion.
- **Optimize Resource Allocation**: Ensures critical services have sufficient resources to handle requests.

## Usage

Simply add the `max_concurrency(n)` middleware to your route, where `n` is the maximum allowed concurrent requests. Requests exceeding this limit will receive a `503 Service Unavailable` response.

_**Example Code**_


**main.rs**

```rust file="<root>/codes/concurrency-limiter/src/main.rs"
use std::fs::create_dir_all;
use std::path::Path;

use salvo::prelude::*;

// Handler for serving the index page with upload forms
#[handler]
async fn index(res: &mut Response) {
    res.render(Text::Html(INDEX_HTML));
}

// Handler for processing file uploads with a simulated delay
#[handler]
async fn upload(req: &mut Request, res: &mut Response) {
    // Extract file from the multipart form data
    let file = req.file("file").await;
    // Simulate a long-running operation (10 seconds)
    tokio::time::sleep(tokio::time::Duration::from_secs(10)).await;

    if let Some(file) = file {
        // Generate destination path for the uploaded file
        let dest = format!("temp/{}", file.name().unwrap_or("file"));
        tracing::debug!(dest = %dest, "upload file");

        // Copy file to destination
        if let Err(e) = std::fs::copy(file.path(), Path::new(&dest)) {
            res.status_code(StatusCode::INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR);
            res.render(Text::Plain(format!("file not found in request: {e}")));
        } else {
            res.render(Text::Plain(format!("File uploaded to {dest}")));
        }
    } else {

    // - /unlimit: Allows unlimited concurrent uploads
    let router = Router::new()
        .get(index)
        .push(
            Router::new()
                .hoop(max_concurrency(1)) // Limit concurrent requests to 1
                .path("limited")
                .post(upload),
        )
        .push(Router::with_path("unlimit").post(upload));

    // Bind server to port 8698 and start serving

# Cross-Origin Control

CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a mechanism that allows browsers to make requests to cross-origin servers, thereby overcoming the restrictions imposed by the browser's same-origin policy.

## What is the Same-Origin Policy?

The same-origin policy is a security feature of browsers that restricts how documents or scripts loaded from one origin can interact with resources from another origin. "Same origin" refers to having the same protocol, domain, and port number.

## Why is CORS Needed?

CORS support is required when a frontend application needs to access APIs from a different origin. For example:

- The frontend application is deployed at `https://frontend.com`
- The API service is deployed at `https://api.backend.com`

Without CORS, the browser will prevent the frontend application from accessing the API service.

## How CORS Works

CORS implements cross-origin access control through a series of HTTP headers:

- **Simple Requests**: Sent directly, with the server controlling whether access is allowed via response headers.
- **Preflight Requests**: The browser first sends an OPTIONS request to ask the server if cross-origin access is allowed, and only sends the actual request after receiving permission.

Since the browser sends preflight requests with `Method::OPTIONS`, it is necessary to handle such requests. The CORS middleware must be added to the `Service`.

## Using CORS in Salvo

Salvo provides built-in CORS middleware that can be easily configured and used. Here is an example code snippet:

:::warning
Note: The `.hoop(cors)` middleware is applied to the `Service`, not the `Router`. This ensures automatic handling of OPTIONS preflight requests.

```rust
let cors = Cors::new()
    .allow_origin(["http://127.0.0.1:8698", "http://localhost:8698"])
    .allow_methods(vec![Method::GET, Method::POST, Method::DELETE])
    .allow_headers("authorization")
    .into_handler();

// Set up backend router with CORS protection
let router = Router::with_path("hello").post(hello);
let service = Service::new(router).hoop(cors);
```

:::

_**Example Code**_


**main.rs**

```rust file="<root>/codes/cors/src/main.rs"
use salvo::cors::Cors;
use salvo::http::Method;
use salvo::prelude::*;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    // Initialize logging system
    tracing_subscriber::fmt().init();
    // Start both backend and frontend servers concurrently
    tokio::join!(backend_server(), frontend_server());
}

async fn backend_server() {
    // Handler that returns a simple message for CORS demonstration
    #[handler]
    async fn hello() -> &'static str {
        "hello, I am content from remote server."
    }

    // Configure CORS middleware with specific settings:
    // - Allow requests from localhost:8698
    // - Allow specific HTTP methods
    // - Allow authorization header
    let cors = Cors::new()
        .allow_origin(["http://127.0.0.1:8698", "http://localhost:8698"])
        .allow_methods(vec![Method::GET, Method::POST, Method::DELETE])
        .allow_headers("authorization")
        .into_handler();

    // Set up backend router with CORS protection
    let router = Router::with_path("hello").post(hello);
    let service = Service::new(router).hoop(cors);

    // Start backend server on port 5600
    let acceptor = TcpListener::new("0.0.0.0:5600").bind().await;
    Server::new(acceptor).serve(service).await;
}

async fn frontend_server() {
    // Handler that serves the HTML page with CORS test
    #[handler]
    async fn index() -> Text<&'static str> {
        Text::Html(HTML_DATA)
    }

    // Set up frontend router to serve the test page
    let router = Router::new().get(index);
    // Start frontend server on port 8698
    let acceptor = TcpListener::new("0.0.0.0:8698").bind().await;
    Server::new(acceptor).serve(router).await;
}

```


## Main Configuration Options

The CORS middleware provides various configuration options:

- **Allowed Origins**: Controls which domains can access resources.
- **Allowed Methods**: Specifies allowed HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.).
- **Allowed Headers**: Specifies allowed request headers.
- **Exposed Headers**: Specifies which response headers can be accessed by the client.
- **Allow Credentials**: Determines whether requests can include credentials such as cookies.
- **Preflight Request Cache Time**: The cache duration for preflight request results.

By configuring CORS appropriately, you can ensure both security and the ability to meet cross-origin access requirements.

# CSRF Protection

## What is CSRF?

CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) is a web security vulnerability where attackers trick authenticated users into performing unintended actions without their knowledge. In simple terms, attackers exploit a user's logged-in status to send malicious requests on their behalf.

## How CSRF Attacks Work

The typical attack process involves:

1. The user logs into the target website A and obtains an authentication cookie.
2. The user visits a malicious website B.
3. Code on malicious website B automatically sends a request to website A, carrying the user's cookie.
4. Website A cannot distinguish whether this is a malicious request or a legitimate user action.

## Protection Strategies

Salvo provides CSRF middleware to protect your applications from such attacks:

- Add a hidden CSRF token to forms.
- Verify that user-submitted requests contain a valid CSRF token.
- By default, validate POST, PATCH, DELETE, and PUT requests.

## CSRF Implementation in Salvo

`Csrf` is a struct that implements the `Handler` trait and includes an internal `skipper` field to specify requests that should skip validation. By default, it validates `Method::POST`, `Method::PATCH`, `Method::DELETE`, and `Method::PUT` requests.

Salvo supports two CSRF token storage methods:

1. **CookieStore**: Stores the token in a cookie and verifies whether the `csrf-token` in the request headers or form matches the cookie value.
2. **SessionStore**: Stores the token in the session and requires the use of session middleware.

_**Example Code**_ (cookie store)

# Flash

A middleware that provides Flash Message functionality.

`FlashStore` offers data storage and retrieval operations. `CookieStore` stores data in `Cookies`, while `SessionStore` stores data in `Session`. `SessionStore` must be used in conjunction with the `session` feature.

_**Example Code**_

### Cookie Storage Example


**main.rs**

```rust file="<root>/codes/flash-cookie-store/src/main.rs"
use std::fmt::Write;

use salvo::flash::{CookieStore, FlashDepotExt};
use salvo::prelude::*;

#[handler]
pub async fn set_flash(depot: &mut Depot, res: &mut Response) {
    let flash = depot.outgoing_flash_mut();
    flash.info("Hey there!").debug("How is it going?");
    res.render(Redirect::other("/get"));
}

#[handler]
pub async fn get_flash(depot: &mut Depot, _res: &mut Response) -> String {
    let mut body = String::new();
    if let Some(flash) = depot.incoming_flash() {
        for message in flash.iter() {
            writeln!(body, "{} - {}", message.value, message.level).unwrap();
        }
    }
    body
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    tracing_subscriber::fmt().init();

    let router = Router::new()
        .hoop(CookieStore::new().into_handler())
        .push(Router::with_path("get").get(get_flash))
        .push(Router::with_path("set").get(set_flash));
    let acceptor = TcpListener::new("0.0.0.0:8698").bind().await;
    Server::new(acceptor).serve(router).await;
}

```

        }
    }
    body
}

# Force HTTPS

The `force-https` middleware can redirect all requests to use the HTTPS protocol.

If this middleware is applied to a `Router`, it will only enforce protocol redirection when a route is matched. If a page does not exist, no redirection will occur.

However, a more common requirement is to automatically redirect any request, even when the route fails to match and returns a `404` error. In such cases, the middleware can be added to the `Service`. Middleware added to the `Service` will always execute, regardless of whether the request is successfully matched by a route.

_**Example Code**_


**main.rs**

```rust file="<root>/codes/force-https/src/main.rs"
use salvo::conn::rustls::{Keycert, RustlsConfig};
use salvo::prelude::*;

#[handler]
async fn hello() -> &'static str {
    "Hello World"
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    tracing_subscriber::fmt().init();

    let router = Router::new().get(hello);
    let service = Service::new(router).hoop(ForceHttps::new().https_port(5443));

    let config = RustlsConfig::new(
        Keycert::new()
            .cert(include_bytes!("../certs/cert.pem").as_ref())
            .key(include_bytes!("../certs/key.pem").as_ref()),
    );
    let acceptor = TcpListener::new("0.0.0.0:5443")
        .rustls(config)
        .join(TcpListener::new("0.0.0.0:8698"))
        .bind()
        .await;
    Server::new(acceptor).serve(service).await;
}

# JWT Authentication

JWT (JSON Web Token) is an open standard (RFC 7519) for securely transmitting information between parties. It is a compact, URL-safe method of representing claims in JSON object format, commonly used for authentication and information exchange.

A JWT consists of three parts:

- **Header** - Specifies the token type and the signing algorithm used
- **Payload** - Contains claims, such as user ID, roles, expiration time, etc.
- **Signature** - Used to verify that the message was not altered during transmission

Typical usage of JWT in authentication flow:

1. After user login, the server generates a JWT token
2. The token is returned to the client and stored (typically in localStorage or cookies)
3. In subsequent requests, the client includes this token in the Authorization header
4. The server validates the token's authenticity and grants access

Provides middleware for JWT Auth authentication.

_**Example Code**_


**main.rs**

```rust file="<root>/codes/jwt-auth/src/main.rs"

# Logging Middleware

Logging plays a crucial role in web applications, as it enables:

- Providing detailed information about the request handling process to help developers track application behavior
- Assisting in troubleshooting and debugging, especially in production environments
- Monitoring application performance and resource usage
- Recording user access patterns and system exceptions
- Meeting security auditing and compliance requirements

Salvo provides a middleware with basic logging functionality. If the middleware is added directly to a `Router`, it will not capture 404 errors returned when no `Router` matches the request. It is recommended to add it to the `Service` instead.

_**Example Code**_


**main.rs**

```rust file="<root>/codes/logging/src/main.rs"
use salvo::logging::Logger;
use salvo::prelude::*;

#[handler]
async fn hello() -> &'static str {
    "Hello World"
}

#[handler]
async fn error() -> StatusError {
    StatusError::bad_request()
        .brief("Bad request error")
        .detail("The request was malformed.")
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    tracing_subscriber::fmt().init();

    let router = Router::new()
        .get(hello)
        .push(Router::with_path("error").get(error));
    let service = Service::new(router).hoop(Logger::new());

    let acceptor = TcpListener::new("0.0.0.0:8698").bind().await;
    Server::new(acceptor).serve(service).await;
}

```

# OpenTelemetry Integration

OpenTelemetry is an open-source observability framework that provides a standardized approach to collecting and exporting telemetry data from applications, including traces, metrics, and logs. It helps developers monitor application performance, troubleshoot issues, and understand the behavior of distributed systems.

Key Advantages of OpenTelemetry:

- Unified APIs and tools with no vendor lock-in
- Support for multiple programming languages and backend systems
- Low-overhead data collection
- Robust support for distributed tracing

Provides middleware with OpenTelemetry support. You can refer to the [example](https://github.com/salvo-rs/salvo/tree/main/examples/otel-jaeger) in the official repository.

# OpenAPI Documentation Generation

OpenAPI is an open-source specification for describing RESTful API interface designs. It defines API request and response structures, parameters, return types, error codes, and other details in JSON or YAML format, making communication between client and server more explicit and standardized.

OpenAPI was originally the open-source version of the Swagger specification and has now become an independent project supported by many large enterprises and developers. Using the OpenAPI specification helps development teams collaborate better, reduce communication costs, and improve development efficiency. Additionally, OpenAPI provides developers with tools for automatically generating API documentation, mock data, and test cases, facilitating development and testing work.

Salvo provides OpenAPI integration (modified from [utoipa](https://github.com/juhaku/utoipa)). Salvo elegantly extracts relevant OpenAPI data type information automatically from `Handler` based on its own characteristics. Salvo also integrates several popular open-source OpenAPI interfaces such as SwaggerUI, Scalar, RapiDoc, and ReDoc.

Since Rust type names can be long and not always suitable for OpenAPI usage, `salvo-oapi` provides the `Namer` type, which allows customizing rules to change type names in OpenAPI as needed.

_**Example Code**_


**main.rs**

```rust file="<root>/codes/oapi-hello/src/main.rs"
use salvo::oapi::extract::*;
use salvo::prelude::*;

#[endpoint]
async fn hello(name: QueryParam<String, false>) -> String {
    format!("Hello, {}!", name.as_deref().unwrap_or("World"))
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    tracing_subscriber::fmt().init();

    let router = Router::new().push(Router::with_path("hello").get(hello));

    let doc = OpenApi::new("test api", "0.0.1").merge_router(&router);

    let router = router
        .unshift(doc.into_router("/api-doc/openapi.json"))
        .unshift(SwaggerUi::new("/api-doc/openapi.json").into_router("/swagger-ui"));

    let acceptor = TcpListener::new("0.0.0.0:8698").bind().await;
    Server::new(acceptor).serve(router).await;
}

```


**Cargo.toml**

```toml file="<root>/codes/oapi-hello/Cargo.toml"
[package]
name = "example-oapi-hello"
version.workspace = true
edition.workspace = true
publish.workspace = true
rust-version.workspace = true

[dependencies]
salvo = { workspace = true, features = ["oapi"] }
tokio = { workspace = true, features = ["macros"] }
tracing.workspace = true
tracing-subscriber.workspace = true

```


Enter `http://localhost:8698/swagger-ui` in your browser to see the Swagger UI page.

The OpenAPI integration in Salvo is quite elegant. For the example above, compared to a normal Salvo project, we just did the following steps:

- Enable the `oapi` feature in `Cargo.toml`: `salvo = { workspace = true, features = ["oapi"] }`;

- Replace `#[handler]` with `#[endpoint]`;

- Use `name: QueryParam<String, false>` to get the value of the query string. When you visit `http://localhost/hello?name=chris`, the `name` query string will be parsed. The `false` in `QueryParam<String, false>` means that this parameter is optional. If you visit `http://localhost/hello`, it will not report an error. On the contrary, if it is `QueryParam<String, true>`, it means that this parameter must be provided, otherwise an error will be returned.

- Create `OpenAPI` and the corresponding `Router`. The `merge_router` in `OpenApi::new("test api", "0.0.1").merge_router(&router)` means that this `OpenAPI` obtains the necessary document information by parsing a certain route and its sub-routes. Some `Handler`s of routes may not provide information for generating documents, and these routes will be ignored, such as `Handler`s defined using the `#[handler]` macro instead of the `#[endpoint]` macro. That is to say, in actual projects, for reasons such as development progress, you can choose not to generate OpenAPI documents, or partially generate OpenAPI documents. Subsequently, you can gradually increase the number of OpenAPI interfaces generated, and all you need to do is change `#[handler]` to `#[endpoint]` and modify the function signature.

## Data Extractors

You can import preset common data extractors through `use salvo::oapi::extract::*;`. The extractor will provide some necessary information to Salvo so that Salvo can generate OpenAPI documents.

- `QueryParam<T, const REQUIRED: bool>`: An extractor for extracting data from query strings. `QueryParam<T, false>` means that this parameter is not required and can be omitted. `QueryParam<T, true>` means that this parameter is required and cannot be omitted. If it is not provided, an error will be returned;

- `HeaderParam<T, const REQUIRED: bool>`: An extractor for extracting data from the request header. `HeaderParam<T, false>` means that this parameter is not required and can be omitted. `HeaderParam<T, true>` means that this parameter is required and cannot be omitted. If it is not provided, an error will be returned;

- `CookieParam<T, const REQUIRED: bool>`: An extractor for extracting data from the request cookie. `CookieParam<T, false>` means that this parameter is not required and can be omitted. `CookieParam<T, true>` means that this parameter is required and cannot be omitted. If it is not provided, an error will be returned;

- `PathParam<T>`: An extractor for extracting path parameters from the request URL. If this parameter does not exist, the route matching will not be successful, so there is no case where it can be omitted;

- `FormBody<T>`: Extracts information from the submitted form of the request;

- `JsonBody<T>`: Extracts information from the JSON-formatted payload submitted by the request;

## `#[endpoint]`

When generating OpenAPI documents, you need to use the `#[endpoint]` macro instead of the regular `#[handler]` macro. It is actually an enhanced version of the `#[handler]` macro.

- It can obtain the necessary information for generating OpenAPI through the function signature;

- For information that is not convenient to provide through the signature, you can directly provide it by adding attributes in the `#[endpoint]` macro. The information provided in this way will be merged with the information obtained through the function signature. If there is a conflict, it will overwrite the information provided by the function signature.

You can use Rust's built-in `#[deprecated]` attribute to mark a Handler as obsolete. Although the `#[deprecated]` attribute supports adding information such as the reason for deprecation and the version, OpenAPI does not support it, so this information will be ignored when generating OpenAPI.

The doc comment part in the code will be automatically extracted to generate OpenAPI. The first line is used to generate _`summary`_, and the entire comment part will be used to generate _`description`_.

```rust
/// This is a summary of the operation
///
/// All lines of the doc comment will be included to operation description.
#[endpoint]
fn endpoint() {}
```

## ToSchema

You can use `#[derive(ToSchema)]` to define data structures:

```rust
#[derive(ToSchema)]
struct Pet {
    id: u64,
    name: String,
}
```

You can use `#[salvo(schema(...))]` to define optional settings:

- `example = ...` can be `json!(...)`. `json!(...)` will be parsed by `serde_json::json!` as `serde_json::Value`.

  ```rust
  #[derive(ToSchema)]
  #[salvo(schema(example = json!({"name": "bob the cat", "id": 0})))]
  struct Pet {
      id: u64,
      name: String,
  }
  ```

- `xml(...)` can be used to define Xml object properties:

  ```rust
  #[derive(ToSchema)]
  struct Pet {
      id: u64,
      #[salvo(schema(xml(name = "pet_name", prefix = "u")))]
      name: String,
  }
  ```

## ToParameters

Generate [path parameters][path_parameters] from the fields of the structure.

This is the `#[derive]` implementation of the [`ToParameters`][to_parameters] trait.

Usually, path parameters need to be defined in [`#[salvo_oapi::endpoint(...parameters(...))]`][path_parameters] of the endpoint. However, when using a [`struct`][struct] to define parameters, the above steps can be omitted. Nevertheless, if you need to give a description or change the default configuration, then [`primitive types`][primitive] and [`String`][std_string] path parameters or \[tuple] style path parameters still need to be defined in `parameters(...)`.

You can use Rust's built-in `#[deprecated]` attribute to mark fields as deprecated, which will be reflected in the generated OpenAPI specification.

The `#[deprecated]` attribute supports adding extra information such as the reason for deprecation or the version from which it is deprecated, but OpenAPI does not support it. OpenAPI only supports a boolean value to determine whether it is deprecated. Although it is perfectly possible to declare a deprecation with a reason, such as `#[deprecated  = "There is better way to do this"]`, this reason will not be presented in the OpenAPI specification.

The comment document on the structure field will be used as the parameter description in the generated OpenAPI specification.

```rust
#[derive(salvo_oapi::ToParameters, serde::Deserialize)]
struct Query {
    /// Query todo items by name.
    name: String
}
```

### ToParameters Container Attributes for `#[salvo(parameters(...))]`

The following attributes can be used in the container attribute `#[salvo(parameters(…))]` of the structure derived from `ToParameters`

- `names(...)` Defines a comma-separated list of names for the unnamed fields of the structure used as path parameters. Only supported on unnamed structures.
- `style = ...` Defines the serialization method for all parameters, specified by [`ParameterStyle`][style]. The default value is based on the _`parameter_in`_ attribute.
- `default_parameter_in = ...` Defines the default position used by the parameters of this field. The value of this position comes from [`parameter::ParameterIn`][in_enum]. If this attribute is not provided, the default is from `query`.
- `rename_all = ...` can be used as an alternative to `serde`'s `rename_all`. It actually provides the same functionality.

Use `names` to define a name for a single unnamed parameter.

```rust
# use salvo_oapi::ToParameters;

#[derive(ToParameters, serde::Deserialize)]
#[salvo(parameters(names("id")))]
struct Id(u64);
```

Use `names` to define names for multiple unnamed parameters.

```rust
# use salvo_oapi::ToParameters;

#[derive(ToParameters, serde::Deserialize)]
#[salvo(parameters(names("id", "name")))]
struct IdAndName(u64, String);
```

### ToParameters Field Attributes for `#[salvo(parameter(...))]`

The following attributes can be used on structure fields `#[salvo(parameter(...))]`:

- `style = ...` Defines how parameters are serialized by [`ParameterStyle`][style]. The default value is based on the _`parameter_in`_ attribute.

- `parameter_in = ...` Use the value from [`parameter::ParameterIn`][in_enum] to define where this field parameter is. If this value is not provided, the default is from `query`.

- `explode` Defines whether to create a new _`parameter=value`_ pair for each parameter in _`object`_ or _`array`_.

- `allow_reserved` Defines whether reserved characters _`:/?#[]@!$&'()*+,;=`_ are allowed in the parameter value.

- `example = ...` can be a method reference or _`json!(...)`_. The given example will override any examples of the underlying parameter type.

- `value_type = ...` can be used to override the default type used by fields in the OpenAPI specification. This is useful when the default type does not correspond to the actual type, for example, when using third-party types not defined in [`ToSchema`][to_schema] or [`primitive` types][primitive]`. The value can be any Rust type that can be serialized to JSON under normal circumstances, or a custom type like _`Object`_._`Object\`\_ that will be rendered as a generic OpenAPI object.

- `inline` If enabled, the definition of this field type must come from [`ToSchema`][to_schema], and this definition will be inlined.

- `default = ...` can be a method reference or _`json!(...)`_.

- `format = ...` can be a variant of the [`KnownFormat`][known_format] enum, or an open value in string form. By default, the format is inferred from the type of the attribute according to the OpenApi specification.

- `write_only` Defines that the attribute is only used for **write** operations _POST,PUT,PATCH_ and not _GET_.

- `read_only` Defines that the attribute is only used for **read** operations _GET_ and not _POST,PUT,PATCH_.

- `nullable` Defines whether the attribute can be `null` (note that this is different from not required).

- `required = ...` is used to force the parameter to be required. [See rules](https://docs.rs/salvo-oapi/latest/salvo_oapi/derive.ToParameters.html#field-nullability-and-required-rules).

- `rename = ...` can be used as an alternative to `serde`'s `rename`. It actually provides the same functionality.

- `multiple_of = ...` is used to define a multiple of the value. The parameter value is considered valid only when the parameter value is divided by the value of this keyword and the result is an integer. The multiple value must be strictly greater than _`0`_.

- `maximum = ...` is used to define the upper limit of the value, including the current value.

- `minimum = ...` is used to define the lower limit of the value, including the current value.

- `exclusive_maximum = ...` is used to define the upper limit of the value, excluding the current value.

- `exclusive_minimum = ...` is used to define the lower limit of the value, excluding the current value.

- `max_length = ...` is used to define the maximum length of a `string` type value.

- `min_length = ...` is used to define the minimum length of a `string` type value.

- `pattern = ...` is used to define a valid regular expression that the field value must match. The regular expression adopts the _ECMA-262_ version.

- `max_items = ...` can be used to define the maximum number of items allowed in an `array` type field. The value must be a non-negative integer.

- `min_items = ...` can be used to define the minimum number of items allowed in an `array` type field. The value must be a non-negative integer.

- `with_schema = ...` uses a function reference to create a _`schema`_ instead of the default _`schema`_. The function must satisfy the definition`fn() -> Into<RefOr<Schema>>`. It does not receive any parameters and must return any value that can be converted to `RefOr<Schema>`.

- `additional_properties = ...` is used to define free-form types for `map`, such as [`HashMap`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/hash_map/struct.HashMap.html) and [`BTreeMap`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/struct.BTreeMap.html). Free-form types allow any type to be used in map values. Supported formats are _`additional_properties`_ and _`additional_properties = true`_.

#### Field nullability and required rules

Some of the rules for nullability and requiredness of _`ToParameters`_ field attributes can also be used for _`ToSchema`_ field attributes. [See rules](https://docs.rs/salvo-oapi/latest/salvo_oapi/derive.ToSchema.html#field-nullability-and-required-rules).

### Partial `#[serde(...)]` attributes support

The ToParameters derive currently supports some [serde attributes][serde attributes]. These supported attributes will be reflected in the generated OpenAPI documentation. The following attributes are currently supported:

- `rename_all = "..."` is supported at the container level.
- `rename = "..."` is **only** supported at the field level.
- `default` is supported at the container and field level according to [serde attributes][serde attributes].
- `skip_serializing_if = "..."` is **only** supported at the field level.
- `with = ...` is **only** supported at the field level.
- `skip_serializing = "..."` is **only** supported at the field or variant level.
- `skip_deserializing = "..."` is **only** supported at the field or variant level.
- `skip = "..."` is **only** supported at the field level.

Other _`serde`_ attributes will affect serialization, but will not be reflected in the generated OpenAPI documentation.

### Examples

_**Demonstrates the use of the `#[salvo(parameters(...))]` container attribute in conjunction with [`ToParameters`][to_parameters] on path parameters, and inlines a query field:**_

```rust
use serde::Deserialize;
use salvo_core::prelude::*;
use salvo_oapi::{ToParameters, ToSchema};

#[derive(Deserialize, ToSchema)]
#[serde(rename_all = "snake_case")]
enum PetKind {
    Dog,
    Cat,
}

#[derive(Deserialize, ToParameters)]
struct PetQuery {
    /// Name of pet
    name: Option<String>,
    /// Age of pet
    age: Option<i32>,
    /// Kind of pet
    #[salvo(parameter(inline))]
    kind: PetKind
}

#[salvo_oapi::endpoint(
    parameters(PetQuery),
    responses(
        (status_code = 200, description = "success response")
    )
)]
async fn get_pet(query: PetQuery) {
    // ...
}
```

_**Use `value_type` to override the `String` type with the `i64` type.**_

```rust
# use salvo_oapi::ToParameters;

#[derive(ToParameters, serde::Deserialize)]
#[salvo(parameters(default_parameter_in = Query))]
struct Filter {
    #[salvo(parameter(value_type = i64))]
    id: String,
}
```

_**Use `value_type` to override the `String` type with the `Object` type. In the OpenAPI specification, the `Object` type will be displayed as `type:object`.**_

```rust
# use salvo_oapi::ToParameters;

#[derive(ToParameters, serde::Deserialize)]
#[salvo(parameters(default_parameter_in = Query))]
struct Filter {
    #[salvo(parameter(value_type = Object))]
    id: String,
}
```

_**You can also use a generic to override the default type of a field.**_

```rust
# use salvo_oapi::ToParameters;

#[derive(ToParameters, serde::Deserialize)]
#[salvo(parameters(default_parameter_in = Query))]
struct Filter {
    #[salvo(parameter(value_type = Option<String>))]
    id: String
}
```

_**You can even use one \[`Vec`] to override another \[`Vec`].**_

```rust
# use salvo_oapi::ToParameters;

#[derive(ToParameters, serde::Deserialize)]
#[salvo(parameters(default_parameter_in = Query))]
struct Filter {
    #[salvo(parameter(value_type = Vec<i32>))]
    id: Vec<String>
}
```

_**We can use another [`ToSchema`][to_schema] to override the field type.**_

```rust
# use salvo_oapi::{ToParameters, ToSchema};

#[derive(ToSchema)]
struct Id {
    value: i64,
}

#[derive(ToParameters, serde::Deserialize)]
#[salvo(parameters(default_parameter_in = Query))]
struct Filter {
    #[salvo(parameter(value_type = Id))]
    id: String
}
```

_**Example of attribute value validation**_

```rust
#[derive(salvo_oapi::ToParameters, serde::Deserialize)]
struct Item {
    #[salvo(parameter(maximum = 10, minimum = 5, multiple_of = 2.5))]
    id: i32,
    #[salvo(parameter(max_length = 10, min_length = 5, pattern = "[a-z]*"))]
    value: String,
    #[salvo(parameter(max_items = 5, min_items = 1))]
    items: Vec<String>,
}
```

_**Use `schema_with` to manually implement the schema for the field.**_

```rust
# use salvo_oapi::schema::Object;
fn custom_type() -> Object {
    Object::new()
        .schema_type(salvo_oapi::SchemaType::String)
        .format(salvo_oapi::SchemaFormat::Custom(
            "email".to_string(),
        ))
        .description("this is the description")
}

#[derive(salvo_oapi::ToParameters, serde::Deserialize)]
#[salvo(parameters(default_parameter_in = Query))]
struct Query {
    #[salvo(parameter(schema_with = custom_type))]
    email: String,
}
```

- `rename_all = ...`: Supports a syntax similar to `serde` to define rules for renaming fields. If both `#[serde(rename_all = "...")]` and `#[salvo(schema(rename_all = "..."))]` are defined, `#[serde(rename_all = "...")]` is preferred.

- `symbol = ...`: A string literal used to define the name path of the structure on the line in OpenAPI. For example, `#[salvo(schema(symbol = "path.to.Pet"))]`.

- `default`: You can use the `Default` implementation of the structure to fill all fields with default values.

### Error Handling

For general applications, we will define a global error type (AppError) and implement `Writer` or `Scribe` for `AppError` so that errors can be sent to the client as web page information.

For OpenAPI, in order to get the necessary error information, we also need to implement `EndpointOutRegister` for this error:

```rust
use salvo::http::{StatusCode, StatusError};
use salvo::oapi::{self, EndpointOutRegister, ToSchema};

impl EndpointOutRegister for Error {
    fn register(components: &mut oapi::Components, operation: &mut oapi::Operation) {
        operation.responses.insert(
            StatusCode::INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR.as_str(),
            oapi::Response::new("Internal server error").add_content("application/json", StatusError::to_schema(components)),
        );
        operation.responses.insert(
            StatusCode::NOT_FOUND.as_str(),
            oapi::Response::new("Not found").add_content("application/json", StatusError::to_schema(components)),
        );
        operation.responses.insert(
            StatusCode::BAD_REQUEST.as_str(),
            oapi::Response::new("Bad request").add_content("application/json", StatusError::to_schema(components)),
        );
    }
}
```

This error set defines all possible error messages that the entire web application may return. However, in many cases, our `Handler` may only contain a few specific error types. In this case, you can use `status_codes` to filter out the required error type information:

```rust
#[endpoint(status_codes(201, 409))]
pub async fn create_todo(new_todo: JsonBody<Todo>) -> Result<StatusCode, Error> {
    Ok(StatusCode::CREATED)
}
```

# Reverse Proxy

A reverse proxy is a server architecture that receives requests from clients and forwards them to one or more backend servers. Unlike a forward proxy (which acts on behalf of clients), a reverse proxy operates on behalf of the server side.

Key advantages of reverse proxies:

- Load Balancing: Distributes requests across multiple servers
- Enhanced Security: Hides real server information
- Content Caching: Improves performance
- Path Rewriting and Forwarding: Routes requests flexibly

The Salvo framework provides middleware for reverse proxy functionality.

_**Example Code**_


**main.rs**

```rust file="<root>/codes/proxy-simple/src/main.rs"
use salvo::prelude::*;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    tracing_subscriber::fmt().init();

    // In this example, if the requested URL begins with <http://127.0.0.1:8698/>, the proxy goes to
    // <https://www.rust-lang.org>; if the requested URL begins with <http://localhost:8698/>, the proxy
    // goes to <https://crates.io>.
    let router = Router::new()
        .push(
            Router::new()
                .host("127.0.0.1")
                .path("{**rest}")
                .goal(Proxy::use_hyper_client("https://docs.rs")),
        )
        .push(
            Router::new()
                .host("localhost")
                .path("{**rest}")
                .goal(Proxy::use_hyper_client("https://crates.io")),
        );

    let acceptor = TcpListener::new("0.0.0.0:8698").bind().await;
    Server::new(acceptor).serve(router).await;
}

```

# Rate Limiting

Middleware providing rate limiting functionality.

## Key Features

- `RateIssuer` provides an abstraction for identifying visitor keys. `RemoteIpIssuer` is one of its implementations, which determines visitors based on their IP addresses. Keys are not necessarily strings; any type satisfying the `Hash + Eq + Send + Sync + 'static` constraints can serve as a key.

- `RateGuard` offers an abstraction for rate limiting algorithms. Default implementations include fixed window (`FixedGuard`) and sliding window (`SlidingGuard`).

- `RateStore` provides data storage operations. `MokaStore` is a built-in in-memory cache implementation based on `moka`. You can also define your own implementation.

- `RateLimiter` is a struct implementing `Handler`, which includes a `skipper` field to specify requests that should bypass rate limiting. By default, `none_skipper` is used, meaning no requests are skipped.

- `QuotaGetter` provides an abstraction for retrieving quotas. It fetches a quota object based on the visitor's `Key`, allowing user quotas and other configurations to be stored in databases and dynamically modified or retrieved.

_**Example Code**_

### Static Quota Example


**main.rs**

```rust file="<root>/codes/rate-limiter-static/src/main.rs"
use salvo::prelude::*;
use salvo::rate_limiter::{BasicQuota, FixedGuard, MokaStore, RateLimiter, RemoteIpIssuer};

#[handler]
async fn hello() -> &'static str {
    "Hello World"
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    tracing_subscriber::fmt().init();

    let limiter = RateLimiter::new(
        FixedGuard::new(),
        MokaStore::new(),
        RemoteIpIssuer,
        BasicQuota::per_second(1),
    );
    let router = Router::with_hoop(limiter).get(hello);
    let acceptor = TcpListener::new("0.0.0.0:8698").bind().await;
    Server::new(acceptor).serve(router).await;
}

```


**Cargo.toml**

# Request Chain ID

The Request ID middleware is highly flexible. The ID generator (IdGenerator) is used to generate IDs, and you can define your own ID generator as long as it implements the `IdGenerator` trait. The default generator provided is `UlidGenerator`.

Additionally, you can control whether to overwrite an existing `requestid`. You can also set `header_name` and other configurations. For details, please [refer to the documentation](https://docs.rs/salvo_extra/latest/salvo_extra/request_id/index.html).

_**Example Code**_


**main.rs**

```rust file="<root>/codes/request-id/src/main.rs"
use salvo::prelude::*;

#[handler]
async fn hello(req: &mut Request) -> String {
    format!("Request id: {:?}", req.header::<String>("x-request-id"))
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    tracing_subscriber::fmt().init();

    let acceptor = TcpListener::new("0.0.0.0:8698").bind().await;
    let router = Router::new().hoop(RequestId::new()).get(hello);
    Server::new(acceptor).serve(router).await;
}

```

# Static Server

Middleware that serves static files or embedded files. For detailed API, please [view the documentation](https://docs.rs/salvo_extra/latest/salvo_extra/request_id/index.html).

## Use Cases

Static file servers have a wide range of applications in web development:

- Serving static resources for websites, such as CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.
- Hosting Single Page Applications (SPAs)
- Distributing documents, media files, downloadable content, etc.
- Serving as a complete hosting solution for simple websites

## Main Features

- `StaticDir` provides support for serving static files from local directories. It can accept a list of multiple directories as parameters. For example:


**main.rs**

```rust file="<root>/codes/static-dir-list/src/main.rs"
use salvo::prelude::*;
use salvo::serve_static::StaticDir;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    tracing_subscriber::fmt().init();

    Server::new(acceptor).serve(router).await;
}

```


**Cargo.toml**

```toml file="<root>/codes/static-dir-list/Cargo.toml"
[package]

[dependencies]
salvo = { workspace = true, features = ["serve-static"] }
tokio = { workspace = true, features = ["macros"] }

```


If a file is not found in the first directory, it will be searched for in the second directory.

`StaticDir` supports serving pre-compressed files when available. For example, if files like `index.html`, `index.html.gz`, `index.html.zst`, and `index.html.br` exist, then `index.html.gz`, `index.html.zst`, and `index.html.br` are considered pre-compressed versions of `index.html`. The appropriate compressed file will be served based on the request information.

- Provides support for `rust-embed`. For example:

## Pros and Cons of rust-embed

**Pros:**

- Compiles static files into the binary, simplifying deployment.
- No need to manage static files separately in production environments.
- Potentially better performance (memory access vs. disk I/O).
- Enhanced security, as files cannot be accidentally modified.

**Cons:**

- Increases the size of the application binary.
- Updating static content requires recompiling and redeploying the entire application.
- Not suitable for large static content that changes frequently.


**main.rs**

```rust file="<root>/codes/static-embed-files/src/main.rs"
use rust_embed::RustEmbed;
use salvo::prelude::*;
use salvo::serve_static::static_embed;

#[derive(RustEmbed)]
#[folder = "static"]
struct Assets;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    tracing_subscriber::fmt().init();

    let router = Router::with_path("{*path}").get(static_embed::<Assets>().fallback("index.html"));

    let acceptor = TcpListener::new("0.0.0.0:8698").bind().await;
    Server::new(acceptor).serve(router).await;
}

```


**Cargo.toml**

```toml file="<root>/codes/static-embed-files/Cargo.toml"
[package]
name = "example-static-embed-files"
version.workspace = true
edition.workspace = true
publish.workspace = true
rust-version.workspace = true

[dependencies]
rust-embed.workspace = true
salvo = { workspace = true, features = ["serve-static"] }
tokio = { workspace = true, features = ["macros"] }
tracing.workspace = true
tracing-subscriber.workspace = true

```


You can set a default page to display using the `default` option. The `with_fallback` and `fallback` methods allow you to specify a fallback file to serve when a requested file is not found, which is useful for certain single-page website applications.

# Session

Middleware providing support for `Session`.

## What is Session

Session refers to user data stored on the server side, typically used to track user state and store temporary data. In web applications, Session addresses the stateless nature of the HTTP protocol, enabling the server to recognize multiple requests from the same user.

## Using Session in Salvo

In Salvo, the Session middleware offers a simple API for reading and writing session data. The `SessionDepot` can be used to obtain a session instance, while methods such as `get`, `set`, and `remove` allow for managing session data.

## Common Use Cases

- User authentication and login state management
- Temporary storage of form data
- Storage of user preference settings

_**Example Code**_

# File Upload Size Limiter Middleware

A middleware for limiting the size of uploaded files in requests.

## Use Cases

Size Limiter is primarily used in the following scenarios:

- Preventing users from uploading excessively large files that consume server resources
- Avoiding server memory overflow caused by malicious attackers uploading massive amounts of data
- Setting different request size limit policies for different API endpoints
- Improving server request processing efficiency and stability

_**Example Code**_

# Server-Sent Events (SSE)

## What is SSE

Server-Sent Events (SSE) is a web technology that allows servers to push data to clients. Unlike WebSocket, SSE is a one-way communication method, where data can only be sent from the server to the client. It is suitable for scenarios where the server needs to push data in real-time, but the client does not need to send data frequently. SSE is based on the HTTP protocol, easy to implement, and comes with built-in reconnection mechanisms.

Provides middleware support for `SSE`.

## Integration with Large Language Models

When integrating AI using OpenAI SDK or other large language model SDKs, streaming responses (Stream) are a common requirement. SSE provides a perfect solution, enabling real-time delivery of AI-generated content to the frontend, thereby offering a better user experience.

For example, when using OpenAI's Chat Completion API with streaming responses, Salvo's SSE functionality can be leveraged to send AI-generated content incrementally to the client, eliminating the delay of waiting for a complete response.

}

#[handler]
async fn user_connected(req: &mut Request, res: &mut Response) -> Result<(), StatusError> {
    let user: Result<User, ParseError> = req.parse_queries();
    match user {
        Ok(user) => {
            WebSocketUpgrade::new().upgrade(req, res, |ws| async move {
                handle_socket(ws, user).await;
            }).await
        }
        Err(_err) => {
            Err(StatusError::bad_request())
        }
    }
}
```

# Timeout Middleware

Provides middleware support for timeout handling.

## Use Cases

In web services, certain requests may take too long to process due to various reasons (such as slow database queries, delayed external service responses, etc.). To prevent these long-running requests from consuming server resources and affecting the processing of other requests, a timeout middleware can be used to set a maximum processing time limit for requests. If this time limit is exceeded, the request will be automatically terminated, and a timeout error will be returned.

_**Example Code**_


**main.rs**

```rust file="<root>/codes/timeout/src/main.rs"
use std::time::Duration;

use salvo::prelude::*;

#[handler]
async fn fast() -> &'static str {
    "hello"
}
#[handler]
async fn slow() -> &'static str {
    tokio::time::sleep(Duration::from_secs(6)).await;
    "hello"
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    tracing_subscriber::fmt().init();

    let acceptor = TcpListener::new("0.0.0.0:8698").bind().await;

    let router = Router::new()
        .hoop(Timeout::new(Duration::from_secs(5)))
        .push(Router::with_path("slow").get(slow))
        .push(Router::with_path("fast").get(fast));

    Server::new(acceptor).serve(router).await;
}

```


**Cargo.toml**

```toml file="<root>/codes/timeout/Cargo.toml"
[package]
name = "example-timeout"
version.workspace = true
edition.workspace = true
publish.workspace = true
rust-version.workspace = true

In the example above, we created two handler functions: a fast-responding `fast` and a `slow` that delays for 6 seconds before responding. A timeout limit of 5 seconds is set for all requests using `Timeout::new(Duration::from_secs(5))`. When accessing the `/slow` path, the request will time out because the processing time exceeds the 5-second limit. In contrast, when accessing the `/fast` path, the request will be processed normally and return a result.

# Tower Middleware Compatibility

Salvo provides compatibility support for the Tower ecosystem through the `tower-compat` feature. For specific APIs, please [refer to the documentation](https://docs.rs/salvo_extra/latest/salvo_extra/tower_compat/index.html).

## Core Concepts of Tower

Tower is a service abstraction library primarily based on two core traits:

### Service Trait

```rust
pub trait Service<Request> {
    type Response;
    type Error;
    type Future: Future<Output = Result<Self::Response, Self::Error>>;

    fn poll_ready(&mut self, cx: &mut Context<'_>) -> Poll<Result<(), Self::Error>>;
    fn call(&mut self, req: Request) -> Self::Future;
}
```

The `Service` trait is responsible for handling requests and returning responses, similar to Salvo's handlers.

### Layer Trait

```rust
pub trait Layer<S> {
    type Service;
    fn layer(&self, inner: S) -> Self::Service;
}
```

The `Layer` trait is used to wrap services and add additional functionality, similar to Salvo's middleware.

## Salvo Compatibility Support

Salvo provides two key traits to achieve compatibility with the Tower ecosystem:

- **TowerLayerCompat**: Converts Tower's `Layer` into Salvo's `Handler`, allowing it to be used as a Hoop (middleware).
- **TowerServiceCompat**: Converts Tower's `Service` into Salvo's `Handler`.

Usage Example:

```rust
// Use Tower's RateLimitLayer and convert it to a Salvo-compatible format via the compat() method
let limit = RateLimitLayer::new(5, Duration::from_secs(30)).compat();
let router = Router::new().hoop(limit).get(hello);
```

_**Example Code**_


**main.rs**

```rust file="<root>/codes/with-tower/src/main.rs"
use salvo::prelude::*;
use tokio::time::Duration;
use tower::limit::RateLimitLayer;

#[handler]
async fn hello() -> &'static str {
    "Hello World"
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    tracing_subscriber::fmt().init();

    let limit = RateLimitLayer::new(5, Duration::from_secs(30)).compat();
    let acceptor = TcpListener::new("0.0.0.0:8698").bind().await;
    let router = Router::new().hoop(limit).get(hello);
    Server::new(acceptor).serve(router).await;
}

```

# Trailing Slash

A middleware for automatically adding or removing trailing `/`.

## Use Cases

The Trailing Slash middleware is particularly useful in the following scenarios:

- **URL Normalization**: Ensures all URLs follow a consistent format (by uniformly adding or removing trailing slashes), which helps improve SEO and avoid duplicate content issues.

- **Simplified Route Handling**: Eliminates the need to write separate routing logic for URLs with and without trailing slashes, as the middleware automatically handles this conversion.

- **Compatibility**: Some clients may automatically add or remove trailing slashes from URLs. This middleware ensures that requests are correctly routed.

- **Redirect Management**: Can be configured to automatically redirect URLs with trailing slashes to those without (or vice versa), enhancing the user experience.

- **Avoiding Route Conflicts**: In many web frameworks, `/path` and `/path/` may be treated as different routes. This middleware can handle them uniformly.

_**Example Code**_


**main.rs**

```rust file="<root>/codes/trailing-slash/src/main.rs"
use salvo::prelude::*;
use salvo::trailing_slash::add_slash;

#[handler]
async fn hello() -> &'static str {
    "Hello"
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    tracing_subscriber::fmt().init();
    let router = Router::with_hoop(add_slash())
        .push(Router::with_path("hello").get(hello))
        .push(Router::with_path("hello.world").get(hello));
    let acceptor = TcpListener::new("0.0.0.0:8698").bind().await;
    Server::new(acceptor).serve(router).await;
}

```

# WebSocket

A middleware that provides support for `WebSocket`.

## Introduction to WebSocket

WebSocket is a protocol that enables full-duplex communication over a single TCP connection. It simplifies data exchange between clients and servers by allowing the server to actively push data to the client. In the WebSocket protocol, the browser and server only need to perform a handshake once to establish a persistent connection and enable bidirectional data transmission.

Unlike traditional HTTP requests, a WebSocket connection remains open after being established, avoiding frequent connection setup and teardown, which significantly reduces communication overhead. This makes WebSocket particularly suitable for real-time applications, such as online games, chat applications, stock tickers, and other applications that require real-time updates.

Salvo provides a concise and powerful API through its WebSocket middleware, enabling developers to easily integrate WebSocket functionality into their applications.

_**Example Code**_


**main.rs**

```rust file="<root>/codes/websocket/src/main.rs"

    let user = req.parse_queries::<User>();
    WebSocketUpgrade::new()
        .upgrade(req, res, |mut ws| async move {
            println!("{user:#?} ");
            while let Some(msg) = ws.recv().await {
                let msg = if let Ok(msg) = msg {
                    msg
                } else {
                    // client disconnected
                    return;
                };

                if ws.send(msg).await.is_err() {
                    // client disconnected
                    return;
                }

# WebTransport

WebTransport is a network transport protocol based on HTTP/3, providing bidirectional communication capabilities between clients and servers while ensuring low latency, high throughput, and security.

## Use Cases

WebTransport is particularly suitable for the following scenarios:

- **Real-time Applications**: Online gaming, real-time collaboration tools, video conferencing, and other applications requiring low-latency communication.
- **Large File Transfers**: Supports high-throughput data transmission, ideal for media streaming and large file uploads/downloads.
- **Multiplexed Communication**: Allows simultaneous establishment of multiple bidirectional and unidirectional data streams.
- **Datagram Communication**: Supports datagram communication without guaranteed order or reliability, suitable for scenarios with extremely high real-time requirements.

Compared to WebSocket, WebTransport offers lower latency and more flexible communication patterns, especially performing better in unstable network environments.

## Salvo Implementation

The Salvo framework provides built-in support for WebTransport, allowing developers to easily build WebTransport-based applications. Key features include:

- Support for establishing WebTransport sessions
- Support for bidirectional stream communication
- Support for unidirectional stream communication
- Support for datagram transmission
- Server-initiated communication streams

### Simple Example

Below is a simplified example of implementing a WebTransport server using Salvo:

```rust
#[handler]
async fn connect(req: &mut Request) -> Result<(), salvo::Error> {
    let session = req.web_transport_mut().await.unwrap();
    
    // Handle datagrams
    if let Ok(Some((_, datagram))) = session.accept_datagram().await {
        // Process received datagram
        let mut resp = BytesMut::from(&b"Response: "[..]);
        resp.put(datagram);
        session.send_datagram(resp.freeze())?;
    }
    
    // Handle bidirectional streams
    if let Ok(Some(webtransport::server::AcceptedBi::BidiStream(_, stream))) = session.accept_bi().await {
        let (send, recv) = salvo::proto::quic::BidiStream::split(stream);
        // Process bidirectional stream data
    }
    
    Ok(())
}
```

### Configuration and Startup

Starting a Salvo application with WebTransport support requires configuring TLS certificates and a QUIC listener:

```rust
let cert = include_bytes!("../certs/cert.pem").to_vec();
let key = include_bytes!("../certs/key.pem").to_vec();

// Configure routing
let router = Router::new().push(Router::with_path("counter").goal(connect));

// Configure TLS
let config = RustlsConfig::new(Keycert::new().cert(cert.as_slice()).key(key.as_slice()));

// Set up listeners
let listener = TcpListener::new(("0.0.0.0", 8698)).rustls(config.clone());
let acceptor = QuinnListener::new(config, ("0.0.0.0", 8698))
    .join(listener)
    .bind()
    .await;

// Start server
Server::new(acceptor).serve(router).await;
```

## Complete Example

To learn more about using WebTransport in Salvo, check out the complete example on GitHub:
[https://github.com/salvo-rs/salvo/blob/main/examples/webtransport](https://github.com/salvo-rs/salvo/blob/main/examples/webtransport)

This example includes complete implementations for both server and client, demonstrating how to handle various types of WebTransport communication.

# Craft Feature

Craft allows developers to automatically generate handler functions and endpoints through simple annotations, while seamlessly integrating with OpenAPI documentation generation.

## Use Cases

The Craft feature is particularly useful in the following scenarios:

- When you need to quickly create route handler functions from struct methods
- When you want to reduce boilerplate code for manual parameter extraction and error handling
- When you need to automatically generate OpenAPI documentation for your API
- When you want to decouple business logic from the web framework

## Basic Usage

To use the Craft feature, you need to import the following modules:

```rust
use salvo::oapi::extract::*;
use salvo::prelude::*;
```

### Creating a Service Struct

Annotate your impl block with the `#[craft]` macro to convert struct methods into handler functions or endpoints.

```rust
#[derive(Clone)]
pub struct Opts {
    state: i64,
}

#[craft]
impl Opts {
    // Constructor
    fn new(state: i64) -> Self {
        Self { state }
    }
    
    // More methods...
}
```

### Creating Handler Functions

Use `#[craft(handler)]` to convert a method into a handler function:

```rust
#[craft(handler)]
fn add1(&self, left: QueryParam<i64>, right: QueryParam<i64>) -> String {
    (self.state + *left + *right).to_string()
}
```

This method will become a handler function that:

- Automatically extracts `left` and `right` values from query parameters
- Accesses the `state` from the struct
- Returns the calculation result as a string response

### Creating Endpoints

Use `#[craft(endpoint)]` to convert a method into an endpoint:

```rust
#[craft(endpoint)]
pub(crate) fn add2(
    self: ::std::sync::Arc<Self>,
    left: QueryParam<i64>,
    right: QueryParam<i64>,
) -> String {
    (self.state + *left + *right).to_string()
}
```

Endpoints can utilize `Arc` to share state, which is particularly useful when handling concurrent requests.

### Static Endpoints

You can also create static endpoints that don't depend on instance state:

```rust
#[craft(endpoint(responses((status_code = 400, description = "Wrong request parameters."))))]
pub fn add3(left: QueryParam<i64>, right: QueryParam<i64>) -> String {
    (*left + *right).to_string()
}
```

In this example, a custom error response description is added, which will be reflected in the generated OpenAPI documentation.

## Parameter Extractors

Salvo's `oapi::extract` module provides various parameter extractors, with the most common including:

- `QueryParam<T>`: Extracts parameters from query strings
- `PathParam<T>`: Extracts parameters from URL paths
- `FormData<T>`: Extracts parameters from form data
- `JsonBody<T>`: Extracts parameters from JSON request bodies

These extractors automatically handle parameter parsing and type conversion, greatly simplifying the writing of handler functions.

## Integration with OpenAPI

The Craft feature can automatically generate API documentation compliant with the OpenAPI specification. In the example:

```rust
let router = Router::new()
    .push(Router::with_path("add1").get(opts.add1()))
    .push(Router::with_path("add2").get(opts.add2()))
    .push(Router::with_path("add3").get(Opts::add3()));

// Generate OpenAPI documentation
let doc = OpenApi::new("Example API", "0.0.1").merge_router(&router);

// Add OpenAPI documentation and Swagger UI routes
let router = router
    .push(doc.into_router("/api-doc/openapi.json"))
    .push(SwaggerUi::new("/api-doc/openapi.json").into_router("swagger-ui"));
```

With this configuration, the API documentation will be available at the `/api-doc/openapi.json` endpoint, and Swagger UI will be accessible at the `/swagger-ui` path.

## Complete Example

Below is a complete example demonstrating how to use the Craft feature to create three different types of endpoints:

```rust
use salvo::oapi::extract::*;
use salvo::prelude::*;
use std::sync::Arc;

#[derive(Clone)]
pub struct Opts {
    state: i64,
}

#[craft]
impl Opts {
    fn new(state: i64) -> Self {
        Self { state }
    }

    #[craft(handler)]
    fn add1(&self, left: QueryParam<i64>, right: QueryParam<i64>) -> String {
        (self.state + *left + *right).to_string()
    }

    #[craft(endpoint)]
    pub(crate) fn add2(
        self: ::std::sync::Arc<Self>,
        left: QueryParam<i64>,
        right: QueryParam<i64>,
    ) -> String {
        (self.state + *left + *right).to_string()
    }

    #[craft(endpoint(responses((status_code = 400, description = "Wrong request parameters."))))]
    pub fn add3(left: QueryParam<i64>, right: QueryParam<i64>) -> String {
        (*left + *right).to_string()
    }
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    // Create shared state with an initial value of 1
    let opts = Arc::new(Opts::new(1));

    // Configure routes for three endpoints
    let router = Router::new()
        .push(Router::with_path("add1").get(opts.add1()))
        .push(Router::with_path("add2").get(opts.add2()))
        .push(Router::with_path("add3").get(Opts::add3()));

    // Generate OpenAPI documentation
    let doc = OpenApi::new("Example API", "0.0.1").merge_router(&router);
    
    // Add OpenAPI documentation and Swagger UI routes
    let router = router
        .push(doc.into_router("/api-doc/openapi.json"))
        .push(SwaggerUi::new("/api-doc/openapi.json").into_router("swagger-ui"));

    // Start the server on localhost:8698
    let acceptor = TcpListener::new("127.0.0.1:8698").bind().await;
    Server::new(acceptor).serve(router).await;
}
```

# Chrono: Rust Date and Time Library

[Chrono](https://docs.rs/chrono/latest/chrono/) aims to provide all functionality needed to do correct operations on dates and times in the proleptic Gregorian calendar:

- The `DateTime` type is timezone-aware by default, with separate timezone-naive types.
- Operations that may produce an invalid or ambiguous date and time return `Option` or `MappedLocalTime`.
- Configurable parsing and formatting with a strftime-inspired date and time formatting syntax.
- The `Local` timezone works with the current local timezone of the OS.
- Types and operations are implemented to be reasonably efficient.
- To avoid increasing the binary size, Chrono does not ship with timezone data by default. Use the companion crates `Chrono-TZ` or `tzfile` for full timezone support.

## Features

[Chrono](https://docs.rs/chrono/latest/chrono/) supports various runtime environments and operating systems, with several features that can be enabled or disabled.

### Default Features:

- `alloc`: Enables features that depend on allocation (primarily string formatting).
- `std`: Enables features that depend on the standard library. This is a superset of `alloc`, adding interoperation with standard library types and traits.
- `clock`: Enables reading the local timezone (`Local`). This is a superset of `now`.
- `now`: Enables reading the system time (`now`).
- `wasmbind`: Provides an interface to the JS Date API for the wasm32 target.

### Optional Features:

- `serde`: Enables serialization/deserialization via serde.
- `rkyv`: Deprecated, use the `rkyv-*` features.
- `rkyv-16`, `rkyv-32`, `rkyv-64`: Enables serialization/deserialization via rkyv, using 16-bit, 32-bit, or 64-bit integers respectively.
- `rkyv-validation`: Enables rkyv validation support using bytecheck.
- `arbitrary`: Constructs arbitrary instances of types with the Arbitrary crate.
- `unstable-locales`: Enables localization. This adds various methods with the `_localized` suffix.

## Overview

### Time Difference/Duration

Chrono provides the `TimeDelta` type to represent the magnitude of a time span. This is an "exact" duration represented in seconds and nanoseconds, and does not represent "nominal" components such as days or months.

The `TimeDelta` type was previously named `Duration` (still available as a type alias). A notable difference from the similar `core::time::Duration` is that it is a signed value rather than unsigned.

### Date and Time

Chrono provides the `DateTime` type to represent a date and time in a timezone.

`DateTime` is timezone-aware and must be constructed from a `TimeZone` object, which defines how the local date is converted to and from UTC. There are three well-known `TimeZone` implementations:

- `Utc` specifies the UTC timezone. It is most efficient.
- `Local` specifies the system local timezone.
- `FixedOffset` specifies an arbitrary fixed offset timezone, such as UTC+09:00 or UTC-10:30.

`DateTime` values with different `TimeZone` types are distinct and cannot be mixed, but can be converted to each other using the `DateTime::with_timezone` method.

You can get the current date and time in the UTC timezone (`Utc::now()`) or in the local timezone (`Local::now()`).

```rust
use chrono::prelude::*;

let utc: DateTime<Utc> = Utc::now(); // e.g., `2014-11-28T12:45:59.324310806Z`
let local: DateTime<Local> = Local::now(); // e.g., `2014-11-28T21:45:59.324310806+09:00`
```

Additionally, you can create your own date and time:

```rust
use chrono::offset::MappedLocalTime;
use chrono::prelude::*;

let dt = Utc.with_ymd_and_hms(2014, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11).unwrap(); // `2014-07-08T09:10:11Z`
```

### Formatting and Parsing

Formatting is done via the `format` method, which format is equivalent to the familiar strftime format.

The default `to_string` method and the `{:?}` specifier also give a reasonable representation. Chrono also provides `to_rfc2822` and `to_rfc3339` methods for common formats.

Chrono now also provides date formatting in almost any language without additional C libraries. This feature is available under the `unstable-locales` feature:

```rust
use chrono::prelude::*;

let dt = Utc.with_ymd_and_hms(2014, 11, 28, 12, 0, 9).unwrap();
assert_eq!(dt.format("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S").to_string(), "2014-11-28 12:00:09");
assert_eq!(dt.format_localized("%A %e %B %Y, %T", Locale::fr_BE).to_string(), 
           "vendredi 28 novembre 2014, 12:00:09");
```

Parsing can be done in two ways:

1. The standard `FromStr` trait (and the `parse` method on strings) can be used to parse `DateTime<FixedOffset>`, `DateTime<Utc>`, and `DateTime<Local>` values.
2. `DateTime::parse_from_str` parses a date and time with an offset and returns `DateTime<FixedOffset>`.

```rust
use chrono::prelude::*;

let dt = "2014-11-28T12:00:09Z".parse::<DateTime<Utc>>().unwrap();
let fixed_dt = DateTime::parse_from_str("2014-11-28 21:00:09 +09:00", "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %z").unwrap();
```

### Conversion to/from Epoch Timestamps

Construct `DateTime<Utc>` from a UNIX timestamp using `DateTime::from_timestamp(seconds, nanoseconds)`.

Get the timestamp (in seconds) from a `DateTime` using `DateTime.timestamp`. Additionally, you can get the additional number of nanoseconds with `DateTime.timestamp_subsec_nanos`.

```rust
use chrono::{DateTime, Utc};

// Construct datetime from epoch:
let dt: DateTime<Utc> = DateTime::from_timestamp(1_500_000_000, 0).unwrap();
assert_eq!(dt.to_rfc2822(), "Fri, 14 Jul 2017 02:40:00 +0000");

// Get epoch value from datetime:
let dt = DateTime::parse_from_rfc2822("Fri, 14 Jul 2017 02:40:00 +0000").unwrap();
assert_eq!(dt.timestamp(), 1_500_000_000);
```

## Limitations

- Only the proleptic Gregorian calendar is supported (i.e., extended to support dates before the era).
- Date types are limited to approximately +/- 262,000 years from the common era.
- Time types are limited to nanosecond precision.
- Leap seconds can be represented, but Chrono does not fully support them.

# Jemallocator: Rust jemalloc Memory Allocator Alternative

:::tip
The default allocator may sometimes fail to release memory promptly. It is recommended to use [jemallocator](https://docs.rs/tikv-jemallocator/latest/tikv_jemallocator/) as a global allocator to replace the default one.
:::

[jemallocator](https://docs.rs/tikv-jemallocator/latest/tikv_jemallocator/) is a library linked with the jemalloc memory allocator, providing the `Jemalloc` unit type that implements the allocator API and can be set as `#[global_allocator]`.

`tikv-jemallocator` is the successor project to `jemallocator`. These two crates are identical except for their names. For new projects, it is recommended to use the `tikv-xxx` version.

## jemalloc Ecosystem

The jemalloc support ecosystem consists of the following crates:

- **tikv-jemalloc-sys**: Builds and links to jemalloc, exposing raw C bindings to it.
- **tikv-jemallocator**: Provides the `Jemalloc` type that implements the `GlobalAlloc` and `Alloc` traits.
- **tikv-jemalloc-ctl**: High-level wrappers for jemalloc control and introspection APIs (the `mallctl*()` function family and `MALLCTL NAMESPACE`).

## Usage

### Adding Dependencies

To use tikv-jemallocator, add it as a dependency:

```toml
[dependencies]

[target.'cfg(not(target_env = "msvc"))'.dependencies]
tikv-jemallocator = "0.5"
```

### Setting as Global Allocator

To set `tikv_jemallocator::Jemalloc` as the global allocator, add the following code to your project:

```rust
#[cfg(not(target_env = "msvc"))]
use tikv_jemallocator::Jemalloc;

#[cfg(not(target_env = "msvc"))]
#[global_allocator]
static GLOBAL: Jemalloc = Jemalloc;
```

That's it! Once this static variable is defined, jemalloc will be used for all memory allocations requested by Rust code within the same program.

## Advantages

jemalloc is a general-purpose malloc implementation focusing on:

- Reducing memory fragmentation
- Scalability in high-concurrency scenarios
- Providing rich introspection and control capabilities

It is particularly useful in the following scenarios:

- Long-running applications
- Memory-intensive workloads
- High-performance services requiring fine-grained memory management

## Compatibility Notes

jemalloc does not support the MSVC target environment and is therefore unavailable when using the MSVC toolchain on Windows. This is why the `cfg(not(target_env = "msvc"))` condition is included in the example code.

# Reqwest: Rust HTTP Client Library

[Reqwest](https://docs.rs/reqwest/latest/reqwest/) is a high-level HTTP client library that simplifies the HTTP request handling process and provides many commonly used features:

- Support for both asynchronous and blocking APIs
- Handling various types of request bodies: plain text, JSON, URL-encoded forms, multipart forms
- Customizable redirect policies
- HTTP proxy support
- TLS encryption enabled by default
- Cookie management

## Basic Usage

### Making a GET Request

For single requests, you can use the `get` convenience method:

```rust
let body = reqwest::get("https://www.rust-lang.org")
    .await?
    .text()
    .await?;

println!("body = {body:?}");
```

> Note: If you plan to make multiple requests, it is better to create a `Client` and reuse it to take advantage of connection pooling.

```rust
let client = reqwest::Client::new();
let res = client.get("https://www.rust-lang.org")
    .send()
    .await?;
```

### Making a POST Request

You can set the request body using the `body()` method:

```rust
let client = reqwest::Client::new();
let res = client.post("http://httpbin.org/post")
    .body("the exact body that is sent")
    .send()
    .await?;
```

### Form Data

Sending form data is a common requirement. You can use any type that can be serialized into form data:

```rust
// This will send a POST request with a body of `foo=bar&baz=quux`
let params = [("foo", "bar"), ("baz", "quux")];
let client = reqwest::Client::new();
let res = client.post("http://httpbin.org/post")
    .form(&params)
    .send()
    .await?;
```

### JSON Data

You can easily send JSON data using the `json` method (requires the `json` feature):

```rust
// This will send a POST request with a body of `{"lang":"rust","body":"json"}`
let mut map = HashMap::new();
map.insert("lang", "rust");
map.insert("body", "json");

let client = reqwest::Client::new();
let res = client.post("http://httpbin.org/post")
    .json(&map)
    .send()
    .await?;
```

### Response Handling

Responses can be handled in various ways:

```rust
let res = client.get("https://www.rust-lang.org").send().await?;

// Get the status code
let status = res.status();

// Get response headers
let content_type = res.headers().get("content-type").unwrap();

// Read the response body as text
let body = res.text().await?;

// Or parse it as JSON
let json: serde_json::Value = res.json().await?;
```

## Advanced Features

### Redirect Policy

By default, the client will automatically handle HTTP redirects, following up to 10 jumps. You can customize this behavior using `ClientBuilder`:

```rust
let custom_client = reqwest::Client::builder()
    .redirect(reqwest::redirect::Policy::none()) // Disable redirects
    .build()?;
```

### Cookie Support

You can enable automatic storage and sending of session cookies via `ClientBuilder`:

```rust
let client = reqwest::Client::builder()
    .cookie_store(true)
    .build()?;
```

### Proxy Settings

System proxies are enabled by default, which will look for HTTP or HTTPS proxy settings in environment variables:

- `HTTP_PROXY` or `http_proxy`: proxy for HTTP connections
- `HTTPS_PROXY` or `https_proxy`: proxy for HTTPS connections
- `ALL_PROXY` or `all_proxy`: proxy for both types of connections

You can also explicitly set a proxy via code:

```rust
let proxy = reqwest::Proxy::http("https://secure.example")?;
let client = reqwest::Client::builder()
    .proxy(proxy)
    .build()?;

// Or disable proxies
let client = reqwest::Client::builder()
    .no_proxy()
    .build()?;
```

### TLS Configuration

The client uses TLS by default to connect to HTTPS targets:

```rust
// Add additional server certificates
let cert = reqwest::Certificate::from_pem(&cert_bytes)?;
let client = reqwest::Client::builder()
    .add_root_certificate(cert)
    .build()?;

// Configure client certificates
let identity = reqwest::Identity::from_pkcs12_der(&pkcs12_der, "password")?;
let client = reqwest::Client::builder()
    .identity(identity)
    .build()?;
```

### Timeout Settings

You can configure timeout durations for requests:

```rust
let client = reqwest::Client::builder()
    .timeout(std::time::Duration::from_secs(10))
    .build()?;
```

## Optional Features

Reqwest provides various optional features that can be enabled or disabled via Cargo features:

- `http2` (enabled by default): support for HTTP/2
- `default-tls` (enabled by default): provides TLS support for HTTPS
- `rustls-tls`: provides TLS functionality using rustls
- `blocking`: provides a blocking client API
- `json`: provides JSON serialization and deserialization functionality
- `multipart`: provides multipart form functionality
- `cookies`: provides cookie session support
- `gzip`, `brotli`, `deflate`, `zstd`: support for various response body decompression
- `socks`: provides SOCKS5 proxy support

## Blocking API

When asynchronous operations are not needed, you can use the blocking API (requires the `blocking` feature):

```rust
let body = reqwest::blocking::get("https://www.rust-lang.org")?.text()?;

let client = reqwest::blocking::Client::new();
let res = client.post("http://httpbin.org/post")
    .json(&map)
    .send()?;
```

# Serde: Rust Serialization and Deserialization Framework

[Serde](https://docs.rs/serde/latest/serde/) is a core library in the Rust ecosystem, providing an efficient and versatile framework for serialization and deserialization. Its name is derived from the combination of "**Ser**ialization" and "**De**serialization."

## Key Features

- **Versatility**: Supports multiple data formats such as JSON, YAML, TOML, MessagePack, and more.
- **Zero-Cost Abstraction**: Code generated at compile time is as efficient as handwritten code.
- **Flexibility**: Allows customization of serialization and deserialization behavior.
- **Strong Typing**: Leverages Rust's type system to ensure data integrity.
- **Wide Adoption**: Serves as the standard library for data exchange in the Rust ecosystem.

## How It Works

The core of Serde lies in its Intermediate Representation (IR) design, which divides the serialization and deserialization processes into two steps:

1. **Serialization**: Converts Rust data structures into a generic intermediate representation, then into the target format.
2. **Deserialization**: Converts input formats into the generic intermediate representation, then into Rust data structures.

This design enables the addition of new data formats without modifying applications that use Serde.

## Basic Usage

### Setting Up Dependencies

```toml
[dependencies]
serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] }
serde_json = "1.0" # Or other format libraries like serde_yaml, toml, etc.
```

### Using Derive Macros

The most common usage involves using derive macros to automatically implement serialization and deserialization traits for structs:

```rust
use serde::{Serialize, Deserialize};

#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Debug)]
struct Point {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}

fn main() {
    let point = Point { x: 1, y: 2 };

    // Convert Point to a JSON string
    let serialized = serde_json::to_string(&point).unwrap();
    println!("Serialized result: {}", serialized); // Output: {"x":1,"y":2}

    // Convert the JSON string back to Point
    let deserialized: Point = serde_json::from_str(&serialized).unwrap();
    println!("Deserialized result: {:?}", deserialized); // Output: Point { x: 1, y: 2 }
}
```

### Attribute Customization

Serde provides a rich set of attributes to customize serialization behavior:

```rust
#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Debug)]
struct User {
    #[serde(rename = "user_id")]
    id: u64,
    
    #[serde(default)]
    name: String,
    
    #[serde(skip_serializing_if = "Option::is_none")]
    email: Option<String>,
    
    #[serde(skip)]
    temporary_data: usize,
}
```

### Supported Data Formats

Serde integrates with various data formats, each with its own crate:

- **serde\_json**: JSON format
- **serde\_yaml**: YAML format
- **toml**: TOML format
- **bincode**: Binary format
- **postcard**: Space-optimized binary format
- **rmp/rmp-serde**: MessagePack format
- **ciborium**: CBOR format
- ...and other formats

## Advanced Usage

### Manual Trait Implementation

For special requirements, you can manually implement the `Serialize` and `Deserialize` traits:

```rust
use serde::{Serialize, Serializer, Deserialize, Deserializer};

struct MyType {
    // Fields...
}

impl Serialize for MyType {
    fn serialize<S>(&self, serializer: S) -> Result<S::Ok, S::Error>
    where
        S: Serializer,
    {
        // Custom serialization logic
    }
}

impl<'de> Deserialize<'de> for MyType {
    fn deserialize<D>(deserializer: D) -> Result<Self, D::Error>
    where
        D: Deserializer<'de>,
    {
        // Custom deserialization logic
    }
}
```

### Type Mapping

You can create mappings between different data representations:

```rust
#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]
#[serde(remote = "chrono::DateTime<chrono::Utc>")]
struct DateTimeRef {
    #[serde(with = "chrono::serde::ts_seconds")]
    pub inner: chrono::DateTime<chrono::Utc>,
}
```

## Learning and Resources

Serde is a feature-rich library, and this article only covers the basics. To fully leverage Serde, it is recommended to:

1. Visit the [Serde official documentation](https://serde.rs/) for detailed APIs and examples.
2. Check the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/serde-rs/serde) for source code and the latest updates.

## Conclusion

As a foundational library in the Rust ecosystem, Serde provides powerful and flexible tools for data exchange. By mastering Serde, you can effortlessly handle various data exchange requirements, making your applications more robust and interoperable.

# Rust Error Handling Libraries

- [thiserror](https://docs.rs/thiserror/latest/thiserror/) provides convenient derive macros for custom error types.

- [snafu](https://docs.rs/snafu/latest/snafu/) is an error handling and reporting framework with context.

- [anyhow](https://docs.rs/anyhow/latest/anyhow/) is a flexible error handling and reporting library.

## thiserror vs snafu

### thiserror

thiserror is a lightweight library that provides derive macros to simplify error definitions.

Features:

- Concise syntax with low ceremony
- Suitable for creating error type libraries and APIs
- Typically used for creating libraries intended for others

```rust
use thiserror::Error;

#[derive(Error, Debug)]
pub enum DataError {
    #[error("Database error: {0}")]
    DatabaseError(#[from] sqlx::Error),
    
    #[error("Validation error: {0}")]
    ValidationError(String),
    
    #[error("Record not found")]
    NotFound,
}
```

### snafu

snafu provides a more comprehensive error handling framework with a focus on error context and error chaining.

Features:

- Encourages more precise error context addition through the "context selector" pattern
- Promotes the "one error enum per module" pattern
- Supports both struct and tuple-style error variants
- Built-in backtrace support

```rust
use snafu::{Snafu, ResultExt, Backtrace};

#[derive(Debug, Snafu)]
pub enum Error {
    #[snafu(display("Failed to read config file {filename:?}"))]
    ReadConfig {
        filename: String,
        source: std::io::Error,
        backtrace: Backtrace,
    },
    
    // Tuple style is also supported
    #[snafu(display("IO error"))]
    Io(#[snafu(source)] std::io::Error, #[snafu(backtrace)] Backtrace),
}

// Context selector example
fn read_config(path: &str) -> Result<Config, Error> {
    std::fs::read_to_string(path).context(ReadConfigSnafu { filename: path })?;
    // ...
}
```

### Comparison

| Feature            | thiserror                 | snafu                               |
| ------------------ | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Syntax conciseness | More concise              | More verbose                        |
| Error context      | Basic support             | Rich context mechanisms             |
| Suitable scale     | Small to medium projects  | Medium to large projects            |
| Lines per error    | \~2 lines per error       | \~5 lines per error                 |
| Error organization | Usually single error enum | Encourages module-level error enums |
| Backtrace support  | No built-in support       | Built-in support                    |

**Selection advice**:

- **Choose thiserror** when you need simple and clear error types, especially in libraries
- **Choose snafu** when you need more structured error handling, particularly in large applications

## anyhow

anyhow is a different error handling library from the above two, focusing on applications rather than libraries.

Features:

- Designed for error handling in applications, not libraries
- Provides a dynamic `anyhow::Error` type that can contain any error implementing the `Error` trait
- Simplifies handling across multiple error types
- No need to define custom error types

```rust
use anyhow::{Context, Result};

fn main() -> Result<()> {
    let config = std::fs::read_to_string("config.json")
        .context("Failed to read config file")?;
        
    let app_config: AppConfig = serde_json::from_str(&config)
        .context("Invalid config format")?;
        
    // Using Result<T> as a type alias for Result<T, anyhow::Error>
    Ok(())
}
```

**anyhow vs thiserror/snafu**:

- anyhow focuses on error handling during rapid application development
- thiserror/snafu focus on creating precise error type hierarchies
- anyhow is typically used in application code
- thiserror/snafu are typically used in library code

In practice, anyhow and thiserror are often used together: libraries use thiserror to define precise error types, while applications use anyhow to handle errors from various sources.
